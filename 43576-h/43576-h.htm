<h3>TO THIS EDITION.</h3>


<p>Since the original Edition of the present work
was published, a gradual and great alteration has
taken place in the nomenclature of the genera,
occasioned by the old ones being further subdivided
according to their natural groups, and each
distinguished as a genus or subgenus by its peculiar
name. These names in the present Edition,
in order to keep pace with the progress of the
science, have been generally adopted, and some
new ones introduced. The improved Index, which
may be had separately by the purchasers of the
former Editions, will point out from what old genera
the new ones have been separated.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>One principal cause of the little attention paid
to Entomology in this country, has doubtless been
the ridicule so often thrown upon the science.
The botanist, sheltered now by the sanction of
fashion, as formerly by the prescriptive union of
his study with medicine, may dedicate his hours
to mosses and lichens without reproach; but in
the minds of most men, the learned as well as
the vulgar, the idea of the trifling nature of his
pursuit is so strongly associated with that of the
diminutive size of its objects, that an <i>entomologist</i>
is synonymous with every thing futile and
childish. Now, when so many other roads to
fame and distinction are open, when a man has
merely to avow himself a botanist, a mineralogist,
or a chemist&mdash;a student of classical literature or
of political economy&mdash;to ensure attention and respect,
there are evidently no great attractions to
lead him to a science which in nine companies
out of ten with which he may associate promises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
to signalize him only as an object of pity or
contempt. Even if he have no other aim than
self-gratification, yet "the sternest stoic of us all
wishes at least for some one to enter into his views
and feelings, and confirm him in the opinion
which he entertains of himself:" but how can
he look for sympathy in a pursuit unknown to
the world, except as indicative of littleness of
mind<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>?</p>

<p>Yet such are the genuine charms of this branch
of the study of nature, that here as well as on the
continent, where, from being equally slighted,
Entomology now divides the empire with her
sister Botany, this obstacle would not have been
sufficient to deter numbers from the study, had
not another more powerful impediment existed&mdash;the
want of a popular and comprehensive Introduction
to the science. While elementary books
on Botany have been multiplied amongst us without
end and in every shape, Curtis's translation of
the <i>Fundamenta Entomologi√¶</i>, published in 1772;
Yeats's <i>Institutions of Entomology</i>, which appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
the year after; and Barbut's <i>Genera Insectorum</i>,
which came out in 1781&mdash;the two former
in too unattractive, and the latter in too expensive
a form for general readers&mdash;are the only
works professedly devoted to this object, which
the English language can boast.</p>

<p>Convinced that this was the chief obstacle to
the spread of Entomology in Britain, the authors
of the present work resolved to do what was in
their power to remove it, and to introduce their
countrymen to a mine of pleasure, new, boundless,
and inexhaustible, and which, to judge from
their own experience&mdash;formed in no contracted
field of comparison&mdash;they can recommend as possessing
advantages and attractions equal to those
held forth by most other branches of human
learning.</p>

<p>The next question was, in what way they should
attempt to accomplish this intention. If they had
contented themselves with the first suggestion that
presented itself, and merely given a translation
of one of the many Introductions to Entomology
extant in Latin, German and French, adding
only a few obvious improvements, their task would
have been very easy; but the slightest examination
showed that, in thus proceeding, they would
have stopped far short of the goal which they
were desirous of reaching.&mdash;In the technical department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
of the science they found much confusion,
and numerous errors and imperfections&mdash;the
same name sometimes applied to parts anatomically
quite different, and different names to
parts essentially the same, while others of primary
importance were without any name at all. And
with reference to the anatomy and physiology of
insects, they could no where meet with a full
and accurate generalization of the various facts
connected with these subjects, scattered here and
there in the pages of the authors who have studied
them.</p>

<p>They therefore resolved to begin, in some measure,
<i>de novo</i>&mdash;to institute a rigorous revision of
the terms employed, making such additions and
improvements as might seem to be called for;
and to attempt a more complete and connected
account of the existing discoveries respecting the
anatomical and physiological departments of the
science than has yet been given to the world:&mdash;and
to these two points their plan at the outset
was limited.</p>

<p>It soon, however, occurred to them, that it
would be of little use to write a book which no
one would peruse; and that in the present age of
love for light reading, there could not be much
hope of leading students to the dry abstractions
of the science, unless they were conducted through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
the attractive portal of the economy and natural
history of its objects. To this department, therefore,
they resolved to devote the first and most considerable
portion of their intended work, bringing
into one point of view, under distinct heads, the
most interesting discoveries of Reaumur, De Geer,
Bonnet, Lyonet, the Hubers, &amp;c., as well as their
own individual observations, relative to the noxious
and beneficial properties of insects; their affection
for their young; their food, and modes of
obtaining it; their habitations; societies; &amp;c. &amp;c.:
and they were the more induced to adopt this plan,
from the consideration, that, though many of the
most striking of these facts have before been presented
to the English reader, a great proportion
are unknown to him; and that no similar generalization
(if a slight attempt towards it in Smellie's
<i>Philosophy of Natural History</i>, and a confessedly
imperfect one in Latreille's <i>Histoire Naturelle
des Crustac√©s et des Insectes</i> be excepted)
has ever been attempted in any language.&mdash;Thus
the entire work would be strictly on the plan of
the <i>Philosophia Entomologica</i> of Fabricius, only
giving a much greater extent to the <i>&#338;conomia</i> and
<i>Usus</i>, and adverting to these in the first place instead
of in the last.</p>

<p>The epistolary form was adopted, not certainly
from any idea of their style being particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
suited to a mode of writing so difficult to keep
from running into incongruities: but simply because
this form admitted of digressions and allusions
called for in a popular work, but which
might have seemed misplaced in a stricter kind
of composition;&mdash;because it is better suited to
convey those practical directions, which in some
branches of the pursuit the student requires;&mdash;and
lastly, because by this form, the objection
against speaking of the manners and economy of
insects before entering upon the definition of
them, and explaining the terms of the science&mdash;a
retrograde course, which they have chosen from
their desire to present the most alluring side of
the science first&mdash;is in great measure, if not
wholly, obviated.</p>

<p>Such is the plan which the authors chalked out
for themselves&mdash;a plan which in the execution
they have found so much more extensive than
they calculated upon, that, could they have foreseen
the piles of volumes through which it has
entailed upon them the labour of wading, often
to glean scarcely more than a single fact&mdash;the
numerous anatomical and technological investigations
which it has called for&mdash;and the long correspondence,
almost as bulky as the entire work,
unavoidably rendered necessary by the distant
residence of the parties&mdash;they would have shrunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
from an undertaking, of which the profit, if by
great chance there should be any, could not be
expected to repay even the cost of books required
in it, and from which any fame must necessarily
be confined to a very limited circle. But having
entered upon it, they have persevered; and if
they succeed in their grand aim, that of making
converts amongst their countrymen to a study
equally calculated for promoting the glory of
God and the delight and profit of man, they will
not deem the labour of the leisure hours of six
years ill bestowed.</p>

<p>And here it may be proper to observe, that one
of their first and favourite objects has been to direct
the attention of their readers "from nature
up to nature's God." For, when they reflected
upon the fatal use which has too often been made
of Natural History, and that from the very works
and wonders of God, some philosophists, by an
unaccountable perversion of intellect, have attempted
to derive arguments either against his
being and providence, or against the Religion
revealed in the Holy Scriptures, they conceived
they might render some service to the most important
interests of mankind, by showing how
every department of the science they recommend
illustrates the great truths of Religion, and proves
that the doctrines of the Word of God, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
being contradicted, are triumphantly confirmed
by his Works.</p>

<p>"To see all things in God" has been accounted
one of the peculiar privileges of a future state;
and in this present life, "to see God in all things,"
in the mirror of the creation to behold and adore
the reflected glory of the Creator, is no mean attainment;
and it possesses this advantage, that
thus we sanctify our pursuits, and, instead of
loving the creatures for themselves, are led by
the survey of them and their instincts to the love
of Him who made and endowed them.</p>

<p>Of their performance of the first part of their
plan, in which there is the least room for originality,
it is only necessary for the authors to say
that they have done their best to make it as comprehensive,
as interesting, and as useful as possible:
but it is requisite to enter somewhat more
fully into what has been attempted in the anatomical,
physiological, and technical parts of the
work.</p>

<p>As far as respects the general physiology and
<i>internal</i> anatomy of insects, they have done little
more than bring together and combine the observations
of the naturalists who have attended to
these branches of the science: but the <i>external</i>
anatomy they have examined for themselves
through the whole class, and, they trust, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
without some new light being thrown upon the
subject; particularly by pointing out and giving
names to many parts never before noticed.</p>

<p>In the <i>Terminology</i>, or what, to avoid the barbarism
of a word compounded of Latin and Greek,
they would beg to call the <i>Orismology</i> of the
science, they have endeavoured to introduce
throughout a greater degree of precision and concinnity&mdash;dividing
it into <i>general</i> and <i>partial</i> Orismology;&mdash;under
the former head defining such
terms as relate to <i>Substance</i>, <i>Resistance</i>, <i>Density</i>,
<i>Proportion</i>, <i>Figure</i>, <i>Form</i>, <i>Superficies</i>, (under
which are introduced <i>Sculpture</i>, <i>Clothing</i>, <i>Colour</i>,
&amp;c.) <i>Margin</i>, <i>Termination</i>, <i>Incision</i>, <i>Ramification</i>,
<i>Division</i>, <i>Direction</i>, <i>Situation</i>, <i>Connection</i>, <i>Arms</i>,
&amp;c.; and under the latter those that relate to the
body and its parts and members, considered in its
great subdivisions of <i>Head</i>, <i>Trunk</i>, and <i>Abdomen</i>.
In short, they may rest their claim of at least aiming
at considerable improvement in this department
upon the great number of new terms, and alterations
of old ones, which they have introduced&mdash;in
external Anatomy alone falling little short of 150.
If it should be thought by any one that they have
made too many changes, they would remind him
of the advice of Bergman to Morveau, when reforming
the nomenclature of Chemistry, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
soundness of which Dugald Stewart has recognised&mdash;"<i>Ne
faites grace √† aucune d√©nomination
impropre. Ceux qui savent d√©j√†, entendront toujours;
ceux qui ne savent pas encore, entendront
plut√¥t.</i>"</p>

<p>Throughout the whole publication, wherever
any fact of importance not depending on their
own authority is mentioned, a reference to the
source whence it has been derived is generally
given; so that, if the work should have no other
value, it will possess that of saving much trouble
to future inquirers, by serving as an index to direct
them in their researches.</p>

<p>The authors are perfectly sensible that, notwithstanding
all their care and pains, many imperfections
will unavoidably remain in their work.
There is no science to which the adage, <i>Dies diem
docet</i>, is more strikingly applicable than to Natural
History. New discoveries are daily made, and
will be made it is probable to the end of time;
so that whoever flatters himself that he can produce
a perfect work in this department will be
miserably disappointed. The utmost that can
reasonably be expected from naturalists is to keep
pace with the progress of knowledge, and this
the authors have used their best diligence to accomplish.
Every new year since they took the
subject in hand up to the very time when the first
sheets were sent to the press, numerous corrections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
and alterations have suggested themselves; and
thus they are persuaded it would be were they to
double the period of delay prescribed by Horace.
But Poetry and Natural History are on a different
footing; and though an author can plead little
excuse for giving his verses to the world while
he sees it possible to polish them to higher excellence,
the naturalist, if he wishes to promote
the extension of his science, must be content to
submit his performances to the public disfigured
by numerous imperfections.</p>

<p>In the introductory letter several of the advantages
to be derived from the study of Entomology
are pointed out; but there is one, which, though
it could not well have been insisted upon in that
place, is too important to be passed over without
notice&mdash;its value in the education of youth.</p>

<p>All modern writers on this momentous subject
unite in recommending in this view, Natural History:
and if "the quality of accurate discrimination&mdash;the
ready perception of resemblances
amongst diversities, and still more the quick and
accurate perception of diversity in the midst of
resemblances&mdash;constitutes one of the most important
operations of the understanding; if it be
indeed the foundation of clear ideas, and the
acquisition of whatever can be truly called knowledge
depends most materially on the possession
of it:"&mdash;if "the best logic be that which teaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
us to suspend our judgements;" and "the art of
seeing, so useful, so universal, and yet so uncommon,
be one of the most valuable a man can possess,"&mdash;there
can be no doubt of the judiciousness
of their advice. Now of all the branches of Natural
History, Entomology is unquestionably the
best fitted for thus disciplining the mind of youth;
and simply from these circumstances, that its objects
have life, are gifted with surprising instincts
admirably calculated to attract youthful attention,
and are to be met with every where. It is not
meant to undervalue the good effects of the study
of Botany or Mineralogy: but it is self-evident
that nothing inanimate can excite such interest in
the mind of a young person as beings endowed
with vitality, exercising their powers and faculties
in so singular a way; which, as Reaumur observes,
are not only alive themselves, but confer
animation upon the leaves, fruits, and flowers that
they inhabit; which every walk offers to view;
and on which new observations may be made
without end.</p>

<p>Besides these advantages, no study affords a
fairer opportunity of leading the young mind by
a natural and pleasing path to the great truths of
Religion, and of impressing it with the most
lively ideas of the power, wisdom, and goodness
of the Creator.</p>

<p>Not that it is recommended to make children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
collectors of insects, nor that young people, to
the neglect of more important duties and pursuits,
should generally become professed Entomologists;
but, if the former be familiarized with
their names, manners, and economy, and the latter
initiated into their classification, it will be an
excellent method of strengthening their habits of
observation, attention, and memory, equal perhaps,
in this respect, to any other mental exercise:
and then, like Major Gyllenhal, who studied Entomology
under Thunberg about 1770, and after
an interval of twenty years devoted to the service
of his country, resumed his favourite pursuit with
all the ardour of youth, and is at this time giving
to the world a description of the insects of Sweden
invaluable for its accuracy and completeness&mdash;they
would be provided in their old age with
an object capable not merely of keeping off that
<i>t√¶dium vit√¶</i> so often inseparable from the relinquishment
of active life, but of supplying an unfailing
fund of innocent amusement, an incentive
to exercise, and consequently no mean degree of
health and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Some, who, with an ingenious author<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, regard
as superfluous all pains to show the utility of Natural
History in reference to the common purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
of life, asking "if it be not enough to open
a source of copious and cheap amusement, which
tends to harmonize the mind, and elevate it to
worthy conceptions of nature and its Author?
if a greater blessing to a man can be offered than
happiness at an easy rate unalloyed by any debasing
mixture?"&mdash;may think the earnestness displayed
on this head, and the length which has
been gone in refuting objections, needless. But
Entomology is so peculiarly circumstanced, that
without removing these obstacles, there could be
no hope of winning votaries to the pursuit. Pliny
felt the necessity of following this course in the
outset of his book which treats on insects, and a
similar one has been originally called for in introducing
the study even to those countries where
the science is now most honoured. In France,
Reaumur, in each of the successive volumes of his
immortal work, found it essential to seize every
opportunity of showing that the study of insects
is not a frivolous amusement, nor devoid of utility,
as his countrymen conceived it; and in Germany
Sulzer had to traverse the same road, telling
us, in proof of the necessity of this procedure,
that on showing his works on insects with their
plates to two very sensible men, one commended
him for employing his leisure hours in preparing
prints that would amuse children and keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
out of mischief, and the other admitted that they
might furnish very pretty patterns for ladies'
aprons! And though in this country things are
not now quite so bad as they were when Lady
Glanville's will was attempted to be set aside on
the ground of lunacy, evinced by no other act
than her fondness for collecting insects, and Ray
had to appear at Exeter on the trial as a witness
of her sanity<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, yet nothing less than line upon
line can be expected to eradicate the deep-rooted
prejudices which prevail on this subject. "Old
impressions," as Reaumur has well observed,
"are with difficulty effaced. They are weakened,
they appear unjust even to those who feel
them, at the moment they are attacked by arguments
which are unanswerable; but the next instant
the proofs are forgotten, and the perverse
association resumes its empire."</p>

<p>The authors do not know that any curiosity
will be excited to ascertain what share has been
contributed to the work by each of them; but if
there should, it is a curiosity they must be excused
from gratifying. United in the bonds of
a friendship, which, though they have to thank
Entomology for giving birth to it, is founded
upon a more solid basis than mere community of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
scientific pursuits, they wish that, whether blame
or praise is the fate of their labours, it may be
jointly awarded. All that they think necessary to
state is, that the composition of each of the different
departments of the work has been, as
nearly as possible, divided between them;&mdash;that
though the letter, or series of letters, on any particular
subject, has been usually undertaken by
one, some of the facts and illustrations have generally
been supplied by the other, and there are
a few to which they have jointly contributed;&mdash;and
that, throughout, the facts for which no other
authority is quoted, are to be considered as resting
upon that of one or other of the authors, but
not always of him, who, from local allusions, may
be conceived the writer of the letter in which they
are introduced, as the matter furnished by each
to the letters of the other must necessarily be
given in the person of the supposed writer.</p>

<p>In acknowledging their obligations to their
friends, the first place is due to <span class="smcap">Simon Wilkin</span>,
Esq. of Costessey near Norwich, to whose liberality
they are indebted for almost all the plates
which illustrate and adorn the work; most of
which have been drawn and engraved by his
artist Mr. <span class="smcap">John Curtis</span>, whose intimate acquaintance
with the subject has enabled him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
give to the figures an accuracy which they could
not have received from one less conversant with
the science. Nor is the reader less under obligation
to Mr. Wilkin's liberality than the authors,
who, if the drawings, &amp;c. had been to be paid
for, must necessarily have contented themselves
with giving a much smaller number.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">Alexander MacLeay</span>, Esq. they are
under particular obligations, for the warm interest
he has all along taken in the work, the judicious
advice he has on many occasions given,
the free access in which he has indulged the
authors to his unrivalled cabinet and well-stored
library, and the numerous other attentions and
accommodations by which he has materially assisted
them in its progress.</p>

<p>To the other friends who have kindly aided
them in this undertaking in any way, they beg
here to offer their best thanks.</p>

<h2>AN
INTRODUCTION
TO
ENTOMOLOGY.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="LETTER_I" id="LETTER_I">LETTER I.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I cannot wonder that an active mind like yours
should experience no small degree of tedium in a situation
so far removed, as you represent your new residence to
be, from "the busy hum of men." Nothing certainly
can compensate for the want of agreeable society; but
since your case in this respect admits of no remedy but
patience, I am glad you are desirous of turning your attention
to some pursuit which may amuse you in the intervals
of severer study, and in part supply the void of
which you complain. I am not a little flattered that you
wish to be informed which class in the three kingdoms
of nature is, in my opinion, most likely to answer your
purpose; at the same time intimating that you feel inclined
to give the preference to Entomology, provided
some objections can be satisfactorily obviated, which you
have been accustomed to regard as urged with a considerable
semblance of reason against the cultivation of
that science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>Mankind in general, not excepting even philosophers,
are prone to magnify, often beyond its just merit, the
science or pursuit to which they have addicted themselves,
and to depreciate any that seems to stand in competition
with their favourite: like the redoubted champions
of romance, each thinks himself bound to take the
field against every one that will not subscribe to the
peerless beauty and accomplishments of his own Dulcinea.
In such conflict for pre-eminence I know no science
that, in this country, has come off worse than Entomology:
her champions hitherto have been so few, and
their efforts so unavailing, that all her rival sisters have
been exalted above her: and I believe there is scarcely
any branch of Natural History that has had fewer British
admirers. While Botany boasts of myriads, she,
though not her inferior either in beauty, symmetry, or
grace, has received the homage of a very slender train
indeed. Since therefore the merits of Entomology have
been so little acknowledged, you will not deem it invidious
if I advocate the cause of this distressed damsel,
and endeavour to effect her restoration to her just rights,
privileges, and rank.</p>

<p>Things that are universally obvious and easy of examination,
as they are the first that fall under our notice,
so are they also most commonly those which we first feel
an inclination to study; while, on the contrary, things
that must be sought for in order to be seen, and which
when sought for avoid the approach and inquiring eye
of man, are often the last to which he directs his attention.
The vegetable kingdom stands in the former predicament.
Flora with a liberal hand has scattered around
us her charming productions; they every where meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and allure us, enchanting us by their beauty, regaling us
by their fragrance, and interesting us as much by their
subservience to our luxuries and comfort, as to the necessary
support and well-being of our life. Beasts, birds,
and fishes also, in some one or other of these respects,
attract our notice; but insects, unfortunate insects, are
so far from attracting us, that we are accustomed to abhor
them from our childhood. The first knowledge that
we get of them is as tormentors; they are usually pointed
out to us by those about us as ugly, filthy, and noxious
creatures; and the whole insect world, butterflies perhaps
and some few others excepted, are devoted by one
universal ban to proscription and execration, as fit only
to be trodden under our feet and crushed: so that often,
before we can persuade ourselves to study them, we have
to remove from our minds prejudices deeply rooted and
of long standing.</p>

<p>Another principal reason which has contributed to
keep Entomology in the back ground arises from the diminutive
size of the objects of which it treats. Being
amongst the most minute of nature's productions, they
do not so readily catch the eye of the observer; and
when they do, mankind in general are so apt to estimate
the worth and importance of things by their bulk, that
because we usually measure them by the duodecimals of
an inch instead of by the foot or by the yard, insects are
deemed too insignificant parts of the creation, and of too
little consequence to its general welfare, to render them
worthy of any serious attention or study. What small
foundation there is for such prejudices and misconception,
I shall endeavour to show in the course of our future
correspondence; my object now, as the champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and advocate of Entomology, is to point out to you her
comparative advantages, and to remove the veil which
has hitherto concealed those attractions, and that grace
and beauty, which entitle her to equal admiration at
least with her sister branches of Natural History.</p>

<p>In estimating the comparative value of the study of
any department in this branch of science, we ought to
contrast it with others, as to the rank its objects hold in
the scale of being; the amusement and instruction which
the student may derive from it; and its utility to society
at large. With respect to public utility, the study of
each of the three kingdoms may perhaps be allowed to
stand upon nearly an equal footing; I shall not, therefore,
enter upon that subject till I come to consider the
question <i>Cui bono?</i> and to point out the uses of Entomology,
but confine myself now to the two first of these
circumstances.</p>

<p>As to rank, I must claim for the entomologist some
degree of precedence before the mineralogist and the
botanist. The mineral kingdom, whose objects are neither
organized nor sentient, stands certainly at the foot
of the scale. Next above this is the vegetable, whose
lovely tribes, though not endued with sensation, are organized.
In the last and highest place ranks the animal
world, consisting of beings that are both organized and
sentient. To this scale of precedence the great modern
luminary of Natural History, notwithstanding that Botany
was always his favourite pursuit, has given his sanction,
acknowledging in the preface to his <i>Fauna Suecica</i>,
that although the vegetable kingdom is nobler than the
mineral, yet the animal is more excellent than the vegetable.
Now it is an indisputable axiom, I should think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
that the more exalted the object the more excellent the
study. By this observation, however, I would by no
means be thought to depreciate or discountenance the
study either of plants or minerals. All the works of our
Creator are great, and worthy of our attention and investigation,
the lowest in the scale as well as the highest,
the most minute and feeble, as well as those that exceed
in magnitude and might. Nor ought those whose inclination
or genius leads them to one department, to say to
those who prefer another&mdash;"we have no need of you"&mdash;for
each in his place, by diffusing the knowledge of his
works and adding to the stock of previous discoveries,
contributes to promote the glory of the Great Architect
of the universe and the good of his creatures.</p>

<p>It is not my wish to claim for my favourite science
more than of right belongs to her; therefore, when the
question is concerning rank, I must concede to the higher
orders of animals, I mean Fishes, Amphibia, Birds, and
Quadrupeds, their due priority and precedence. I shall
only observe here, that there may exist circumstances
which countervail rank, and tend to render the study of
a lower order of beings more desirable than that of a
higher: when, for instance, the objects of the higher
study are not to be come at or preserved without great
difficulty and expense; when they are few in number;
or, when they are already well ascertained and known:
circumstances which attach to the study of those animals
that precede insects, while they do not attach to the
study of insects themselves.</p>

<p>With regard to the amusement and instruction of the
student, much doubtless may be derived from any one of
the sciences alluded to: but Entomology certainly is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
behind any of her sisters in these respects; and if you
are fond of novelty, and anxious to make new discoveries,
she will open to you a more ample field for these
than either Botany or the higher branches of Zoology.</p>

<p>A new vertebrate animal or plant is seldom to be met with
even by those who have leisure and opportunity for extensive
researches; but if you collect insects, you will find,
however limited the manor upon which you can pursue
your game, that your efforts are often rewarded by the
capture of some non-descript or rarity at present not possessed
by other entomologists, for I have seldom seen a
cabinet so meagre as not to possess some unique specimen.
Nay, though you may have searched every spot
in your neighbourhood this year, turned over every stone,
shaken every bush or tree, and fished every pool, you
will not have exhausted its insect productions. Do the
same another and another, and new treasures will still
continue to enrich your cabinet. If you leave your own
vicinity for an entomological excursion, your prospects
of success are still further increased; and even if confined
in bad weather to your inn, the windows of your apartment,
as I have often experienced, will add to your stock.
If a sudden shower obliges you at any time to seek shelter
under a tree, your attention will be attracted, and the
tedium of your station relieved, where the botanist could
not hope to find even a new lichen or moss, by the appearance
of several insects, driven there perhaps by the
same cause as yourself, that you have not observed before.
Should you, as I trust you will, feel a desire to
attend to the manners and economy of insects, and become
ambitious of making discoveries in this part of entomological
science, I can assure you, from long experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
that you will here find an inexhaustible fund of
novelty. For more than twenty years my attention has
been directed to them, and during most of my summer
walks my eyes have been employed in observing their
ways; yet I can say with truth, that so far from having
exhausted the subject, within the last six months I have
witnessed more interesting facts respecting their history
than in many preceding years. To follow only the insects
that frequent your own garden, from their first to
their last state, and to trace all their proceedings, would
supply an interesting amusement for the remainder of
your life, and at its close you would leave much to be
done by your successor; for where we know thoroughly
the history of one insect, there are hundreds concerning
which we have ascertained little besides the bare fact of
their existence.</p>

<p>But numerous other sources of pleasure and information
will open themselves to you, not inferior to what any
other science can furnish, when you enter more deeply
into the study. Insects, indeed, appear to have been nature's
favourite productions, in which, to manifest her
power and skill, she has combined and concentrated almost
all that is either beautiful and graceful, interesting
and alluring, or curious and singular, in every other class
and order of her children. To these, her valued miniatures,
she has given the most delicate touch and highest
finish of her pencil. Numbers she has armed with glittering
mail, which reflects a lustre like that of burnished
metals<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; in others she lights up the dazzling radiance of
polished gems<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>. Some she has decked with what looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
like liquid drops, or plates of gold and silver<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; or with
scales or pile, which mimic the colour and emit the ray
of the same precious metals<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. Some exhibit a rude exterior,
like stones in their native state<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, while others represent
their smooth and shining face after they have
been submitted to the tool of the polisher: others, again,
like so many pygmy Atlases bearing on their backs a
microcosm, by the rugged and various elevations and depressions
of their tuberculated crust, present to the eye
of the beholder no unapt imitation of the unequal surface
of the earth, now horrid with mis-shapen rocks, ridges,
and precipices&mdash;now swelling into hills and mountains,
and now sinking into valleys, glens, and caves<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; while
not a few are covered with branching spines, which fancy
may form into a forest of trees<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>What numbers vie with the charming offspring of Flora
in various beauties! some in the delicacy and variety of
their colours, colours not like those of flowers evanescent
and fugitive, but fixed and durable, surviving their subject,
and adorning it as much after death as they did
when it was alive; others, again, in the veining and texture
of their wings; and others in the rich cottony down
that clothes them. To such perfection, indeed, has nature
in them carried her mimetic art, that you would declare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
upon beholding some insects, that they had robbed
the trees of their leaves to form for themselves artificial
wings, so exactly do they resemble them in their form,
substance, and vascular structure; some representing
green leaves, and others those that are dry and withered<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
Nay, sometimes this mimicry is so exquisite, that you
would mistake the whole insect for a portion of the
branching spray of a tree<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. No mean beauty in some
plants arises from the fluting and punctuation of their
stems and leaves, and a similar ornament conspicuously
distinguishes numerous insects, which also imitate with
multiform variety, as may particularly be seen in the
caterpillars of many species of the butterfly tribe (<i>Papilionid√¶</i>),
the spines and prickles which are given as
a <i>Noli me tangere</i> armour to several vegetable productions.</p>

<p>In fishes the lucid scales of varied hue that cover and
defend them are universally admired, and esteemed their
peculiar ornament; but place a butterfly's wing under a
microscope, that avenue to unseen glories in new worlds,
and you will discover that nature has endowed the most
numerous of the insect tribes with the same privilege,
multiplying in them the forms<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and diversifying the
colouring of this kind of clothing beyond all parallel.
The rich and velvet tints of the plumage of birds are
not superior to what the curious observer may discover
in a variety of <i>Lepidoptera</i>; and those many-coloured
eyes which deck so gloriously the peacock's tail are
imitated with success by one of our most common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
butterflies<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. Feathers are thought to be peculiar to birds;
but insects often imitate them in their antenn√¶<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, wings<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>,
and even sometimes in the covering of their bodies<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.&mdash;We
admire with reason the coats of quadrupeds,
whether their skins be covered with pile, or wool, or fur;
yet are not perhaps aware that a vast variety of insects
are clothed with all these kinds of hair, but infinitely
finer and more silky in texture, more brilliant and delicate
in colour, and more variously shaded than what any
other animals can pretend to.</p>

<p>In variegation insects certainly exceed every other
class of animated beings. Nature, in her sportive mood,
when painting them, sometimes imitates the clouds of
heaven; at others, the meandering course of the rivers
of the earth, or the undulations of their waters: many
are veined like beautiful marbles; others have the semblance
of a robe of the finest net-work thrown over them;
some she blazons with heraldic insignia, giving them to
bear in fields sable&mdash;azure&mdash;vert&mdash;gules&mdash;argent and
or, fesses&mdash;bars&mdash;bends&mdash;crosses&mdash;crescents&mdash;stars, and
even animals<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>. On many, taking her rule and compasses,
she draws with precision mathematical figures;
points, lines, angles, triangles<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, squares, and circles. On
others she portrays, with mystic hand, what seem like
hieroglyphic symbols, or inscribes them with the characters
and letters of various languages, often very correctly
formed<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; and, what is more extraordinary, she has registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in others figures which correspond with several
dates of the Christian era<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor has nature been lavish only in the apparel and
ornament of these privileged tribes; in other respects
she has been equally unsparing of her favours. To
some she has given fins like those of fish, or a beak resembling
that of birds<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>; to others horns, nearly the
counterparts of those of various quadrupeds. The bull<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>,
the stag<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, the rhinoceros<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, and even the hitherto vainly
sought for unicorn<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, have in this respect many representatives
amongst insects. One is armed with tusks not
unlike those of the elephant<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>; another is bristled with
spines, as the porcupine and hedge-hog with quills<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; a
third is an armadillo in miniature; the disproportioned
hind legs of the kangaroo give a most grotesque appearance
to a fourth<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>; and the threatening head of the snake
is found in a fifth<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. It would, however, be endless to
produce all the instances which occur of such imitations:
and I shall only remark that, generally speaking, these
arms and instruments in structure and finishing far exceed
those which they resemble.</p>

<p>But further, insects not only mimic, in a manner infinitely
various, every thing in nature, they may also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with very little violence be regarded as symbolical of
beings out of and above nature. The butterfly, adorned
with every beauty and every grace, borne by radiant
wings through the fields of ether, and extracting nectar
from every flower, gives us some idea of the blessed inhabitants
of happier worlds, of angels, and of the spirits
of the just arrived at their state of perfection. Again,
other insects seem emblematical of a different class of
unearthly beings: when we behold some tremendous for
the numerous horns and spines projecting in horrid
array from their head or shoulders;&mdash;others for their
threatening jaws of fearful length, and armed with cruel
fangs: when we survey the dismal hue and demoniac air
that distinguish others, the dens of darkness in which
they live, the impurity of their food, their predatory habits
and cruelty, the nets which they spread, and the
pits which they sink to entrap the unwary, we can scarcely
help regarding them as aptly symbolizing evil demons,
the enemies of man, or of impure spirits for their vices
and crimes driven from the regions of light into darkness
and punishment<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>The sight indeed of a well-stored cabinet of insects
will bring before every beholder not conversant with
them, forms in endless variety, which before he would
not have thought it possible could exist in nature, resembling
nothing that the other departments of the animal
kingdom exhibit, and exceeding even the wildest
fictions of the most fertile imagination. Besides prototypes
of beauty and symmetry, there in miniature he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
be amused to survey (for the most horrible creatures
when deprived of the power of injury become sources of
interest and objects of curiosity), to use the words of our
great poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">... all prodigious things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abominable, unutterable, and worse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chim√¶ras dire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the pleasures of a student of the science to which
I am desirous of introducing you, are far from being
confined to such as result from an examination of the
exterior form and decorations of insects: for could these,
endless as they seem, be exhausted, or, wonderful as
they are, lose their interest, yet new sources, exuberant
in amusement and instruction, may be opened, which
will furnish an almost infinite fund for his curiosity to
draw upon. The striking peculiarity and variety of
structure which they exhibit in their instruments of nutrition,
motion, and oviposition; in their organs of sensation,
generation, and the great fountains of vitality,&mdash;indeed
their whole system, anatomically considered, will
open a world of wonders to you with which you will not
soon be satiated, and during your survey of which you
will at every step feel disposed to exclaim with the Roman
naturalist&mdash;"In these beings so minute, and as it
were such non-entities, what wisdom is displayed, what
power, what unfathomable perfection<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>!" But even this
will not bring you to the end of your pleasures: you
must leave the dead to visit the living; you must behold
insects when full of life and activity, engaged in their
several employments, practising their various arts, pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
their amours, and preparing habitations for their
progeny: you must notice the laying and kind of their
eggs; their wonderful metamorphoses; their instincts,
whether they be solitary or gregarious; and the other
miracles of their history&mdash;all of which will open to you
a richer mine of amusement and instruction, I speak it
without hesitation, than any other department of Natural
History can furnish. A minute enumeration of these
particulars would be here misplaced, and only forestall
what will be detailed more at large hereafter; but a rapid
glance at a very few of the most remarkable of them,
may serve as a stimulus to excite your curiosity, and induce
you to enter with greater eagerness into the wide
field to which I shall conduct you.</p>

<p>The lord of the creation plumes himself upon his
powers of invention, and is proud to enumerate the various
useful arts and machines to which they have given
birth, not aware that "He who teacheth man knowledge"
has instructed these despised insects to anticipate
him in many of them. The builders of Babel doubtless
thought their invention of turning earth into artificial
stone, a very happy discovery<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>; yet a little bee<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> had
practised this art, using indeed a different process, on a
small scale, and the white ants on a large one, ever since
the world began. Man thinks that he stands unrivalled
as an architect, and that his buildings are without a parallel
among the works of the inferior orders of animals.
He would be of a different opinion did he attend to the
history of insects: he would find that many of them have
been architects from time immemorial; that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
had their houses divided into various apartments, and
containing staircases, gigantic arches, domes, colonnades,
and the like; nay, that even tunnels are excavated
by them so immense, compared with their own size,
as to be twelve times bigger than that projected by Mr.
Dodd to be carried under the Thames at Gravesend<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.
The modern fine lady, who prides herself on the lustre
and beauty of the scarlet hangings which adorn the stately
walls of her drawing-room, or the carpets that cover
its floor, fancying that nothing so rich and splendid was
ever seen before, and pitying her vulgar ancestors, who
were doomed to unsightly white-wash and rushes, is ignorant
all the while, that before she or her ancestors
were in existence, and even before the boasted Tyrian
dye was discovered, a little insect had known how to
hang the walls of its cell with tapestry of a scarlet more
brilliant than any her rooms can exhibit<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>; and that
others daily weave silken carpets, both in tissue and
texture infinitely superior to those she so much admires.
No female ornament is more prized and costly than lace,
the invention and fabrication of which seems the exclusive
claim of the softer sex. But even here they have
been anticipated by these little industrious creatures,
who often defend their helpless chrysalis, by a most singular
covering, and as beautiful as singular, of lace<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
Other arts have been equally forestalled by these creatures.
What vast importance is attached to the invention
of paper! For near six thousand years one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
commonest insects has known how to make and apply it
to its purposes<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>; and even pasteboard, superior in substance
and polish to any we can produce, is manufactured
by another<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>. We imagine that nothing short of
human intellect can be equal to the construction of a
diving-bell or an air-pump&mdash;yet a spider is in the daily
habit of using the one, and, what is more, one exactly
similar in principle to ours, but more ingeniously contrived;
by means of which she resides unwetted in the
bosom of the water, and procures the necessary supplies
of air by a much more simple process than our alternating
buckets<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>&mdash;and the caterpillar of a little moth knows
how to imitate the other, producing a vacuum, when
necessary for its purposes, without any piston besides its
own body<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. If we think with wonder of the populous
cities which have employed the united labours of man
for many ages to bring them to their full extent, what
shall we say to the white ants, which require only a few
months to build a metropolis capable of containing an
infinitely greater number of inhabitants than even imperial
Nineveh, Babylon, Rome, or Pekin, in all their
glory?</p>

<p>That insects should thus have forestalled us in our
inventions ought to urge us to pay a closer attention to
them and their ways than we have hitherto done, since
it is not at all improbable that the result would be many
useful hints for the improvement of our arts and manufactures,
and perhaps for some beneficial discoveries.
The painter might thus probably be furnished with more
brilliant pigments, the dyer with more delicate tints, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the artisan with a new and improved set of tools. In
this last respect insects deserve particular notice. All
their operations are performed with admirable precision
and dexterity; and though they do not usually vary the
mode, yet that mode is always the best that can be conceived
for attaining the end in view. The instruments
also with which they are provided are no less wonderful
and various than the operations themselves. They have
their saws, and files, and augers, and gimlets, and knives,
and lancets, and scissors, and forceps, with many other
similar implements; several of which act in more than
one capacity, and with a complex and alternate motion
to which we have not yet attained in the use of our
tools. Nor is the fact so extraordinary as it may seem
at first, since "He who is wise in heart and wonderful
in working" is the inventor and fabricator of the apparatus
of insects; which may be considered as a set of
miniature patterns drawn for our use by a Divine hand.
I shall hereafter give you a more detailed account of
some of the most striking of these instruments; and if
you study insects in this view, you will be well repaid
for all the labour and attention you bestow upon them.</p>

<p>But a more important species of instruction than any
hitherto enumerated may be derived from entomological
pursuits. If we attend to the history and manners of
insects, they will furnish us with many useful lessons in
Ethics, and from them we may learn to improve ourselves
in various virtues. We have indeed the inspired
authority of the wisest of mankind for studying them in
this view, since he himself wrote a treatise upon them,
and sends his sluggard to one for a lesson of wisdom<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
And if we value diligence and indefatigable industry;
judgement, prudence, and foresight; economy and frugality;
if we look upon modesty and diffidence as female
ornaments; if we revere parental affection&mdash;of all these,
and many more virtues, insects in their various instincts
exhibit several striking examples, as you will see in the
course of our correspondence.</p>

<p>With respect to religious instruction insects are far
from unprofitable; indeed in this view Entomology
seems to possess peculiar advantages above every other
branch of Natural History. In the larger animals,
though we admire the consummate art and wisdom manifested
in their structure, and adore that Almighty
power and goodness which by a wonderful machinery,
kept in motion by the constant action and re-action of
the great positive and negative powers of Nature, maintains
in full force the circulations necessary to life, perception,
and enjoyment; yet as there seems no disproportion
between the objects and the different operations
that are going on in them, and we see that they afford
sufficient space for the play of their systems, we do not
experience the same sensations of wonder and astonishment
that strike us when we behold similar operations
carried on without interruption in animals scarcely visible
to the naked eye. That creatures, which in the scale
of being are next to non-entities, should be elaborated
with so much art and contrivance, have such a number
of parts both internal and external, all so highly finished
and each so nicely calculated to answer its end; that
they should include in this evanescent form such a variety
of organs of perception and instruments of motion,
exceeding in number and peculiarity of structure those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of other animals; that their nervous and respiratory systems
should be so complex, their secretory and digestive
vessels so various and singular, their parts of generation
so clearly developed, and that these minims of nature
should be endowed with instincts in many cases superior
to all our boasted powers of intellect&mdash;truly these wonders
and miracles declare to every one who attends to
the subject, "The hand that made us is divine." We
are the work of a Being infinite in power, in wisdom,
and in goodness.</p>

<p>But no religious doctrine is more strongly established
by the history of insects than that of a superintending
Providence. That of the innumerable species of these
beings, many of them beyond conception fragile and exposed
to dangers and enemies without end, no link
should be lost from the chain, but all be maintained in
those relative proportions necessary for the general good
of the system; that if one species for a while preponderate,
and instead of preserving seem to destroy, yet
counterchecks should at the same time be provided to
reduce it within its due limits; and further, that the
operations of insects should be so directed and overruled
as to effect the purposes for which they were created
and never exceed their commission: nothing can furnish
a stronger proof than this, that an unseen hand holds
the reins, now permitting one to prevail and now another,
as shall best promote certain wise ends; and saying
to each, "Hitherto shalt thou come and no further."</p>

<p>So complex is this mundane system, and so incessant
the conflict between its component parts, an observation
which holds good particularly with regard to insects,
that if instead of being under such control it were left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the agency of blind chance, the whole must inevitably
soon be deranged and go to ruin. Insects, in truth, are
a book in which whoever reads under proper impressions
cannot avoid looking from the effect to the cause,
and acknowledging his eternal power and godhead thus
wonderfully displayed and irrefragably demonstrated:
and whoever beholds these works with the eyes of the
body, must be blind indeed if he cannot, and perverse
indeed if he will not, with the eye of the soul behold in
all his glory the Almighty Workman, and feel disposed,
with every power of his nature, to praise and magnify</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Him first, Him last, Him midst, Him without end."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now having led you to the vestibule of an august
temple, which in its inmost sanctuary exhibits enshrined
in glory the symbols of the Divine Presence, I should
invite you to enter and give a tongue to the Hallelujahs,
which every creature in its place, by working his will
with all its faculties, pours forth to its great Creator:
but I must first endeavour to remove, as I trust I shall
effectually, those objections to the study of these interesting
beings which I alluded to in the outset of this
letter, and this shall be the aim of my next address.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_II" id="LETTER_II">LETTER II.</a></h2>

<h3><i>OBJECTIONS ANSWERED.</i></h3>


<p>In my last I gave you a general view of the science of
Entomology, and endeavoured to prove to you that it
possesses attractions and beauty sufficient to reward any
student who may profess himself its votary. I am now
to consider it in a less alluring light, as a pursuit attended
by no small degree of obloquy, in consequence
of certain objections thought to be urged with great
force against it. To obviate these, and remove every
scruple from your mind, shall be the business of the
present letter.</p>

<p>Two principal objections are usually alleged with great
confidence against the study and pursuit of insects. By
some they are derided as trifling and unimportant, and
deemed an egregious waste of time and talents; by others
they are reprobated as unfeeling and cruel, and as tending
to harden the heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I. I shall begin with the first of these objections&mdash;that
the entomologist is a mere trifler. As for the silly
outcry and abuse of the ignorant vulgar, who are always
ready to laugh at what they do not understand, and because
insects are minute objects conclude that the study
of them must be a childish pursuit, I shall not waste
words upon what I so cordially despise. But since even
learned men and philosophers, from a partial and prejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
view of the subject, having recourse to this common-place
logic, are sometimes disposed to regard all
inquiry into these minuti√¶ of nature as useless and idle,
and the mark of a little mind; to remove such prejudice
and misconceptions I shall now dilate somewhat upon
the subject of <i>Cui bono?</i></p>

<p>When we see many wise and learned men pay attention
to any particular department of science, we may
naturally conclude that it is on account of some profit
and instruction which they foresee may be derived from
it; and therefore in defending Entomology I shall first
have recourse to the <i>Argumentum ad verecundiam</i>, and
mention the great names that have cultivated or recommended
it.</p>

<p>We may begin the list with the first man that ever
lived upon the earth, for we are told that he gave a
name to every living creature<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>, amongst which insects
must be included; and to give an appropriate name to
an object necessarily requires some knowledge of its
distinguishing properties. Indeed one of the principal
pleasures and employments of the paradisiacal state was
probably the study of the various works of creation<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.
Before the fall the book of nature was the Bible of man,
in which he could read the perfections and attributes of
the invisible Godhead<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, and in it, as in a mirror, behold
an image of the things of the spiritual world. Moses
also appears to have been conversant with our little
animals, and to have studied them with some attention.
This he has shown, not only by being aware of the
distinctions which separate the various tribes of grasshoppers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
crickets &amp;c. (<i>Gryllus</i>, L.) into different genera<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>,
but also by noticing the different direction of the two
anterior from the four posterior legs of insects; for, as
he speaks of them as going upon four legs<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>, it is evident
that he considered the two anterior as arms. Solomon,
the wisest of mankind, made Natural History a peculiar
object of study, and left treatises behind him upon its
various branches, in which <i>creeping things</i> or insects
were not overlooked<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; and a wiser than Solomon directs
our attention to natural productions, when he bids us
<i>consider</i> the lilies of the field<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, teaching us that they are
more worthy of our notice than the most glorious works
of man: he also not obscurely intimates that insects are
symbolical beings, when he speaks of scorpions as synonymous
with evil spirits<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>; thus giving into our hands
a clue for a more profitable mode of studying them, as
furnishing moral and spiritual instruction.</p>

<p>If to these scriptural authorities we add those of uninspired
writers, ancient and modern, the names of many
worthies, celebrated both for wisdom and virtue, may be
produced. Aristotle among the Greeks, and Pliny the
elder among the Romans, may be denominated the fathers
of Natural History, as well as the greatest philosophers
of their day; yet both these made insects a principal
object of their attention: and in more recent times,
if we look abroad, what names greater than those of
Redi, Malpighi, Vallisnieri, Swammerdam, Leeuwenhoek,
Reaumur, Linn√©, De Geer, Bonnet, and the
Hubers? and at home, what philosophers have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
more honour to their country and to human nature than
Ray, Willughby, Lister, and Derham? Yet all these
made the study of insects one of their most favourite
pursuits; and, as if to prove that this study is not incompatible
with the highest flights of genius, we can
add to the list the name of one of the most sublime of
our poets, Gray, who was very zealously devoted to Entomology.
As far therefore as names have weight, the
above enumeration seems sufficient to shelter the votaries
of this pleasing science from the charge of folly.</p>

<p>But we do not wish to rest our defence upon authorities
alone; let the voice of reason be heard, and our
justification will be complete. The entomologist, or, to
speak more generally, the naturalist (for on this question
of <i>Cui bono?</i> every student in all departments of Natural
History is concerned), if the following considerations
be allowed their due weight, may claim a much
higher station amongst the learned than has hitherto
been conceded to him.</p>

<p>There are two principal avenues to knowledge&mdash;the
study of words and the study of things. Skill in the
learned languages being often necessary to enable us to
acquire knowledge in the former way, is usually considered
as knowledge itself; so that no one asks <i>Cui bono?</i>
when a person devotes himself to the study of verbal
criticism, and employs his time in correcting the errors
that have crept into the text of an ancient writer. Indeed
it must be owned, though perhaps too much stress
is sometimes laid upon it, that this is very useful to enable
us to ascertain his true meaning. But after all,
words are but the arbitrary signs of ideas, and have no
value independent of those ideas, further than what arises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from congruity and harmony, the mind being dissatisfied
when an idea is expressed by inadequate words, and the
ear offended when their collocation is inharmonious. To
account the mere knowledge of words, therefore, as wisdom,
is to mistake the cask for the wine, and the casket
for the gem. I say all this because knowledge of words
is often extolled beyond its just merits, and put for all
wisdom; while knowledge of things, especially of the productions
of nature, is derided as if it were mere folly.
We should recollect that God hath condescended to instruct
us by both these ways, and therefore neither of
them should be depreciated. He hath set before us his
word and his world. The former is the great avenue to
truth and knowledge by the study of <i>words</i>, and, as being
the immediate and authoritative revelation of his will,
is entitled to our <i>principal</i> attention; the latter leads us
to the same conclusions, though less directly, by the
study of <i>things</i>, which stands next in rank to that of
God's word, and before that of any work of man. And
whether we direct our eyes to the planets rolling in their
orbits, and endeavour to trace the laws by which they
are guided through the vast of space, whether we analyse
those powers and agents by which all the operations of
nature are performed, or whether we consider the various
productions of this our globe, from the mighty cedar
to the microscopic mucor&mdash;from the giant elephant to the
invisible mite, still we are studying the works and wonders
of our God. The book, to whatever page we turn,
is written by the finger of him who created us; and in it,
provided our minds be rightly disposed, we may read his
eternal verities. And the more accurate and enlarged
our knowledge of his works, the better shall we be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to understand his word; and the more practised we are
in his word, the more readily shall we discern his truth
in his works; for, proceeding from the same great Author,
they must, when rightly interpreted, mutually explain
and illustrate each other.</p>

<p>Who then shall dare maintain, unless he has the hardihood
to deny that God created them, that the study of
insects and their ways is trifling or unprofitable? Were
they not arrayed in all their beauty, and surrounded with
all their wonders, and made so instrumental (as I shall
hereafter prove them to be) to our welfare, that we might
glorify and praise him for them? Why were insects made
attractive, if not, as Ray well expresses it, that they might
ornament the universe and be delightful objects of contemplation
to man<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>? And is it not clear, as Dr. Paley
has observed, that the production of beauty was as much
in the Creator's mind in painting a butterfly or in studding
a beetle, as in giving symmetry to the human frame,
or graceful curves to its muscular covering<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>? And shall
we think it beneath us to study what he hath not thought
it beneath him to adorn and place on this great theatre
of creation? Nay, shall we extol those to the skies who
bring together at a vast expense the most valuable specimens
of the arts, the paintings and statues of Italy and
Greece, all of which, however beautiful, as works of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
fall short of perfection; and deride and upbraid those
who collect, for the purpose of admiring their beauty,
the finished and perfect chef-d'&#339;uvres of a Divine artist?
May we gaze with rapture unblamed upon an Apollo of
Belvedere, or Venus de Medicis, or upon the exquisite
paintings of a Raphael or a Titian, and yet when we behold
with ecstasy sculptures that are produced by the
chisel of the Almighty, and the inimitable tints laid on
by his pencil, because an insect is the subject, be exposed
to jeers and ridicule?</p>

<p>But there is another reason, which in the present age
renders the study of Natural History an object of importance
to every well-wisher to the cause of Religion,
who is desirous of exerting his faculties in its defence.
For as enthusiasm and false religion have endeavoured
to maintain their ground by a perversion of the text of
<i>scripture</i>, so also the patrons of infidelity and atheism
have laboured hard to establish their impiety by a perversion
of the text of <i>nature</i>. To refute the first of these
adversaries of truth and sound religion, it is necessary
to be well acquainted with the <i>word</i> of God; to refute
the second, requires an intimate knowledge of his <i>works</i>;
and no department can furnish him with more powerful
arguments of every kind than the world of insects&mdash;every
one of which cries out in an audible voice, There is a
God&mdash;he is Almighty, all-wise, all-good&mdash;his watchful
providence is ever, and every where, at work for the preservation
of all things.</p>

<p>But since mankind in general are too apt to look chiefly
at this world, and to regard things as important or otherwise
in proportion as they are connected with sublunary
interests, and promote our present welfare, I shall proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
further to prove that the study of insects may be
productive of considerable utility, even in this view, and
may be regarded in some sort as a necessary or at least
a very useful concomitant of many arts and sciences.</p>

<p>The importance of insects to us both as sources of good
or evil, I shall endeavour to prove at large hereafter; but
for the present, taking this for granted, it necessarily follows
that the study of them must also be important. For
when we suffer from them, if we do not know the cause,
how are we to apply a remedy that may diminish or prevent
their ravages? Ignorance in this respect often occasions
us to mistake our enemies for our friends, and our
friends for our enemies; so that when we think to do good
we only do harm, destroying the innocent and letting the
guilty escape. Many such instances have occurred. You
know the orange-coloured fly of the wheat, and have read
the account of the damage done by this little insect to
that important grain; you are aware also that it is given
in charge to three little parasites to keep it within due
limits; yet at first it was the general opinion of unscientific
men, that these destroyers of our enemy were its
parents, and the original source of all the mischief<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.
Middleton, in his "<i>Agriculture of Middlesex</i>," speaking
of the Plant-louse that is so injurious to the bean, tells
us that the lady-birds are supposed either to generate
or to feed upon them<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Had he been an entomologist,
he would have been in no doubt whether they were
beneficial or injurious: on the contrary, he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
recommended that they should be encouraged as friends
to man, since no insects are greater devourers of the
Aphides. The confounding of the apple Aphis (<i>A. lanigera,
Myzoxyla?</i><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>) that has done such extensive injury
to our orchards, with others, has led to proceedings still
more injurious. This is one of those species from the
skin of which transpires a white cottony secretion. Some
of the proprietors of orchards about Evesham, observing
an insect which secreted a similar substance upon the
poplar, imagined that from this tree the creature which
they had found so noxious was generated; and in consequence
of this mistaken notion cut down all their poplars<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.
The same indistinct ideas might have induced
them to fell all their larches and beeches, since they also
are infested by Aphides which transpire a similar substance.
Had these persons possessed any entomological
knowledge, they would have examined and compared the
insects before they had formed their opinions, and being
convinced that the poplar and apple Aphis are distinct
species, would have saved their trees.</p>

<p>But could an entomological observer even ascertain
the species of any noxious insect, still in many cases,
without further information, he may fall short of his purpose
of prevention. Thus we are told that in Germany
the gardeners and country people, with great industry,
gather whole baskets full of the caterpillar of the destructive
cabbage moth (<i>Mamestra Brassic√¶</i>), and then bury
them, which, as Roesel well observes<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, is just as if we
should endeavour to kill a crab by covering it with water;
for, many of them being full grown and ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
pass into their next state, which they do underground,
instead of destroying them by this man&#339;uvre, their appearing
again the following year in greater numbers is
actually facilitated. Yet this plan applied to our common
cabbage caterpillar, which does not go underground,
would succeed. So that some knowledge of the manners
of an insect is often requisite to enable us to check its ravages
effectually. With respect to noxious caterpillars
in general, agriculturists and gardeners are not usually
aware that the best mode of preventing their attacks is to
destroy the female fly before she has laid her eggs, to do
which the moth proceeding from each must be first ascertained.
But if their research were carried still further,
so as to enable them to distinguish the pupa and discover
its haunts, and it would not be at all difficult to detect
that of the greatest pest of our gardens, the cabbage butterfly,
the work might be still more effectually accomplished.
Some larv√¶ are polyphagous, or feed upon a
variety of plants; amongst others that of the yellow-tail
moth (<i>Arctia chrysorh&#339;a</i>); yet gardeners think they
have done enough if they destroy the web-like nests
which so often deform our fruit-trees, without suspecting
that new armies of assailants will wander from those on
other plants which they have suffered to remain. Thus
will thousands be produced in the following season,
which, had they known how to distinguish them, might
have been extirpated. Another instance occurred to me
last year, when walking with a gentleman in his estate at
a village in Yorkshire. Our attention was attracted by
several circular patches of dead grass, each having a stick
with rags suspended to it, placed in the centre. I at once
discerned that the larva of the cock-chafer had eaten the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
roots of the grass, which being pulled up by the rooks
that devour this mischievous grub, these birds had been
mistaken by the tenant for the cause of the evil, and the
rags were placed to frighten away his best friends. On
inquiry why he had set up these sticks, he replied, "He
could n't beer to see'd nasty craws pull up all'd gess, and
sae he'd set'd bairns to hing up some aud clouts to flay
'em away. Gin he'd letten 'em alean they'd sean hev
reated up all'd close." Nor could I convince him by all
that I could say, that the rooks were not the cause of the
evil. Even philosophers sometimes fall into gross mistakes
from this species of ignorance. Dr. Darwin has observed,
that destroying the beautiful but injurious woodpeckers
is the only alternative for preventing the injury
they do to our forest-trees by boring into them<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>; not
being aware that they bore only those trees which insects
have previously attacked, and that they diminish very
considerably the number of such as are prejudicial to our
forests.</p>

<p>From these facts it is sufficiently evident that entomological
knowledge is necessary both to prevent fatal mistakes,
and to enable us to check with effect the ravages
of insects. But ignorance in this respect is not only unfit
to remedy the evil; on the contrary, it may often be
regarded as its cause. A large proportion of the most
noxious insects in every country are not indigenous, but
have been imported. It was thus that the moth (<i>Galleria
Mellonella</i>) so destructive in bee-hives, and the asparagus
beetle (<i>Lema Asparagi</i>) were made denizens of
Sweden<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. The insect that has destroyed all the peach-trees
in St. Helena was imported from the Cape: and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
home (not to mention bugs and cock-roaches) the great
pest of our orchards, before mentioned, the apple Aphis,
there is good reason to believe, was introduced with some
foreign apple-trees. Now, extensive as is our commerce,
it is next to impossible, by any precautions, to prevent
the importation of these noxious agents. A cargo, or
even a sample, of peas from North America might present
us with that ravager of pulse, the pea-beetle (<i>Bruchus
Pisi</i>); or the famed Hessian fly, which some years
ago caused such trepidation in our cabinet, might be
conveyed here in a ship-load of wheat. Leeuwenhoek's
wolf (<i>Tinea granella</i>) might visit us, in a similar conveyance,
from Holland or France. But though introduced,
were Entomology a more general pursuit, their
presence would soon be detected, and the evil at once
nipt in the bud; whereas in a country where this science
was not at all or little cultivated, they would most probably
have increased to such an extent before they attracted
notice, that every effort to extirpate them would
be ineffectual.</p>

<p>It is needless to insist upon the importance of the study
of insects, as calculated to throw light upon some of the
obscurest points of general physiology; nor would it be
difficult, though the task might be invidious, to point out
how grossly incorrect and deficient are many of the speculations
of our most eminent philosophers, solely from
their ignorance of this important branch of Natural History.
How little qualified would that physiologist be to
reason conclusively upon the mysterious subject of generation,
who should be ignorant of the wonderful and unlooked-for
fact, brought to light by the investigations of
an entomologist, that one sexual intercourse is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to fertilize the eggs of numerous generations of Aphides!
And how defective would be all our reasonings on the
powers of nutrition and secretion, had we yet to learn
that in insects both are in action unaccompanied by the
circulating system and glands of larger animals!</p>

<p>In another point of view entomological information is
very useful. A great deal of unnecessary mischief is produced,
and unnecessary uneasiness occasioned, by what
are called vulgar errors, and that superstitious reliance
upon charms, which prevents us from having recourse to
remedies that are really efficacious. Thus, for instance,
eating figs and sweet things has been supposed to generate
lice<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. Nine larv√¶ of the moth of the wild teasel inclosed
in a reed or goose quill have been reckoned a remedy
for ague<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. Matthiolus gravely affirms that every
oak-gall contains either a fly, a spider, or a worm; and
that the first foretells war, the second pestilence, and the
third famine<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>. In Sweden the peasants look upon the
grub of the cock-chafer as furnishing an unfailing prognostic
whether the ensuing winter will be mild or severe;
if the animal have a blueish hue (a circumstance
which arises from its being replete with food) they affirm
it will be mild, but on the contrary if it be white the weather
will be severe: and they carry this so far as to foretell,
that if the anterior part be white and the posterior
blue, the cold will be most severe at the beginning of the
winter. Hence they call this grub <i>Bem√§rkelse-mask</i>, or
prognostic worm<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. A similar augury as to the harvest
is drawn by the Danish peasants from the mites which
infest the common dung beetle (<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
called in Danish <i>Skarnbosse</i> or <i>Torbist</i>. If there are
many of these mites between the fore feet, they believe
that there will be an early harvest, but a late one if they
abound between the hind feet<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. The appearance of
the death's head hawk-moth (<i>Acherontia Atropos</i>) has in
some countries produced the most violent alarm and
trepidation amongst the people, who, because it emits
a plaintive sound, and is marked with what looks like a
death's head upon its back, regarded it as the messenger
of pestilence and death<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. We learn from Linn√© that a
similar superstition, built upon the black hue and strange
aspect of that beetle, prevails in Sweden with respect to
<i>Blaps mortisaga</i>, L.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; and in Barbadoes, according to
Hughes, the ignorant deem the appearance of a certain
grasshopper in their houses as a sure presage of illness
to some of the family<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>One would not think that the excrements of insects
could be objects of terror, yet so it has been. Many
species of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, when they emerge from the pupa
state, discharge from their anus a reddish fluid, which, in
some instances, where their numbers have been considerable,
has produced the appearance of a shower of blood;
and by this natural fact, all those bloody showers, recorded
by historians as preternatural, and regarded where
they happened as fearful prognostics of impending evils,
are stripped of their terrors, and reduced to the class of
events that happen in the common course of nature.
That insects are the cause of these showers is no recent
discovery; for Sleidan relates that in the year 1553 a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
vast multitude of butterflies swarmed through a great
part of Germany, and sprinkled plants, leaves, buildings,
clothes and men, with bloody drops, as if it had rained
blood<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>. But the most interesting account of an event
of this kind is given by Reaumur, from whom we learn
that in the beginning of July 1608 the suburbs of Aix,
and a considerable extent of country round it, were covered
with what appeared to be a shower of blood. We
may conceive the amazement and stupor of the populace
upon such a discovery, the alarm of the citizens, the
grave reasonings of the learned. All agreed however in
attributing this appearance to the powers of darkness,
and in regarding it as the prognostic and precursor of
some direful misfortune about to befall them. Fear and
prejudice would have taken deep root upon this occasion,
and might have produced fatal effects upon some weak
minds, had not M. Peiresc, a celebrated philosopher of
that place, paid attention to insects. A chrysalis which
he preserved in his cabinet, let him into the secret of this
mysterious shower. Hearing a fluttering, which informed
him his insect was arrived at its perfect state, he opened
the box in which he kept it. The animal flew out and
left behind it a red spot. He compared this with the
spots of the bloody shower, and found they were alike.
At the same time he observed there was a prodigious
quantity of butterflies flying about, and that the drops of
the miraculous rain were not to be found upon the tiles,
nor even upon the upper surface of the stones, but chiefly
in cavities and places where rain could not easily come.
Thus did this judicious observer dispel the ignorant fears
and terror which a natural phenomenon had caused<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The same author relates an instance of the gardener of
a gentleman being thrown into a horrible fright by digging
up some of the curious cases, which I shall hereafter
describe to you, of the leaf-cutter bees, and which he
conceived to be the effect of witchcraft portending some
terrible misfortune. By the advice of the priest of the
parish he even took a journey from Rouen to Paris, to
show them to his master: but he, happily having more
sense than the man, carried them to M. Nollet, an eminent
naturalist, who having seen similar productions was
aware of the cause, and opening one of the cases, while
the gardener stood aghast at his temerity, pointed out
the grub that it contained, and thus sent him back with
a light heart, relieved from all his apprehensions<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>Every one has heard of the death-watch, and knows
of the superstitious notion of the vulgar, that in whatever
house its drum is heard one of the family will die before
the end of the year. These terrors, in particular instances,
where they lay hold of weak minds, especially
of sick or hypochondriac persons, may cause the event
that is supposed to be prognosticated. A small degree
of entomological knowledge would relieve them from all
their fears, and teach them that this heart-sickening tick
is caused by a small beetle (<i>Anobium tessellatum</i>) which
lives in timber, and is merely a call to its companion.
Attention to Entomology may therefore be rendered very
useful in this view, since nothing certainly is more desirable
than to deliver the human mind from the dominion
of superstitious fears, and false notions, which having
considerable influence on the conduct of mankind are the
cause of no small portion of evil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>But as we cannot well guard against the injuries produced
by insects, or remove the evil, whether real or
arising from misconceptions respecting them, which they
occasion, unless we have some knowledge of them; so
neither without such knowledge can we apply them, when
beneficial, to our use. Now it is extremely probable that
they might be made vastly more subservient to our advantage
and profit than at present, if we were better acquainted
with them. It is the remark of an author, who
himself is no entomologist: "We have not taken animals
enough into alliance with us. The more spiders there
were in the stable, the less would the horses suffer from
the flies. The great American fire-fly should be imported
into Spain to catch mosquitos. In hot countries a reward
should be offered to the man who could discover
what insects feed upon fleas<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>." It would be worth our
while to act upon this hint, and a similar one of Dr.
Darwin. Those insects might be collected and preserved
that are known to destroy the Aphides and other injurious
tribes; and we should thus be enabled to direct
their operations to any quarter where they would be most
serviceable; but this can never be done till experimental
agriculturists and gardeners are conversant with insects,
and acquainted with their properties and economy. How
is it that the Great Being of beings preserves the system
which he has created from permanent injury, in consequence
of the too great redundancy of any individual
species, but by employing one creature to prey upon another,
and so overruling and directing the instincts of all,
that they may operate most where they are most wanted!
We cannot better exercise the reasoning powers and faculties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with which he has endowed us, than by copying
his example. We often employ the larger animals to
destroy each other, but the smaller, especially insects,
we have totally neglected. Some may think, perhaps,
that in aiming to do this we should be guilty of presumption,
and of attempting to take the government and direction
of things out of the hands of Providence: but
this is a very weak argument, which might with equal
reason be adduced to prove that when rats and mice become
troublesome to us, we ought not to have recourse to
dogs, ferrets, and cats to exterminate them. When any
species multiplies upon us, so as to become noxious, we
certainly have a just right to destroy it, and what means
can be more proper than those which Providence itself
has furnished? We can none of us go further or do more
than the Divine Will permits; and he will take care that
our efforts shall not be injurious to the general welfare,
or effect the annihilation of any individual species.</p>

<p>Again, with regard to insects that are employed in
medicine or the arts, if the apothecary cannot distinguish
a Cantharis or blister-beetle from a Carabus or Cetonia,
both of which beetles I have found mixed with the
former, how can he know whether his druggist furnishes
him with a good or bad article? And the same observation
may with still greater force apply to the dyer in
his purchase of cochineal, since it is still more difficult
to distinguish the wild sort from the cultivated. There
are, it is probable, many insects that might be employed
with advantage in both these departments: but unless
Entomology be more generally studied by scientific men,
who are the only persons likely to make discoveries of
this kind, than it has hitherto been, we must not hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
to derive further profit from them. It seems more particularly
incumbent upon the professors of the divine art
of healing to become conversant with this as well as the
other branches of Natural History; for not only do they
derive some of their most useful drugs from insects, but
many also of the diseases upon which they are consulted,
as we shall see hereafter, are occasioned by them. For
want of this kind of information medical men run the
risk of confounding diseases perfectly distinct, at least as
to the animal that causes them. It would be a most
desirable thing to have professors in each branch of Natural
History in our universities, and to make it indispensable,
in order to the obtaining of any degree in
Physic, that the candidate should have attended these
lectures. We may judge from the good effects that the
arts have derived from the present very general attention
to Chemistry, how beneficial would be the consequence
if Entomology were equally cultivated: and I shall conclude
this paragraph with what I think may be laid down
as an incontrovertible axiom:&mdash;That the profit we derive
from the works of creation will be in proportion to
the accuracy of our knowledge of them and their properties.</p>

<p>I trust I have now said enough to convince you and
every thinking man that the study of insects, so far from
being vain, idle, trifling, or unprofitable, may be attended
with very important advantages to mankind, and ought
at least to be placed upon a level with many other
branches of science, against which such accusations are
never alleged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But I must not conceal from you that there are objectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
who will still return to the charge. They will
say, "We admit that the pursuits of the entomologist
are important when he directs his views to the destruction
of noxious insects; the discovery of new ones likely
to prove beneficial to man; and to practical experiments
upon their medical and economical properties. But where
are the entomologists that in fact pursue this course?
Do they not in reality wholly disregard the economical
department of their science, and content themselves with
making as large a collection of species as possible; ascertaining
the names of such as are already described; describing
new ones; and arranging the whole in their cabinets
under certain families and genera? And can a
study with these sole ends in view deserve a better epithet
than trifling? Even if the entomologist advance a
step further, and invent a new system for the distribution
of all known insects, can his laborious undertaking be
deemed any other than busy idleness? What advantage
does the world derive from having names given to ten or
twenty thousand insects, of which numbers are not bigger
than a pin's head, and of which probably not a hundredth
part will ever be of any use to mankind?"</p>

<p>Now in answer to this supposed objection, which I
have stated as forcibly as I am able, and which, as it
may be, and often is, urged against every branch of Natural
History as at present studied, well deserves a full
consideration, I might in the first place deny that those
who have the highest claim to rank as entomologists do
confine their views to the systematic department of the
science to the neglect of economical observations; and
in proof of my assertion, I might refer abroad to a Linn√©,
a Reaumur, a De Geer, a Huber, and various other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
names of the highest reputation; and at home to a Ray,
a Lister, a Derham, a Marsham, a Curtis, a Clark, a
Roxburgh, &amp;c. But I do not wish to conceal that
though a large proportion of entomologists direct their
views much further than to the mere nomenclature of
their science, there exists a great number, probably the
majority, to whom the objection will strictly apply. Now
I contend, and shall next endeavour to prove, that entomologists
of this description are devoting their time to
a most valuable end; and are conferring upon society a
benefit incalculably greater than that derived from the
labours of many of those who assume the privilege of
despising their pursuit.</p>

<p>Even in favour of the mere butterfly-hunter&mdash;he who
has no higher aim than that of collecting a <i>picture</i> of
<i>Lepidoptera</i>, and is attached to insects solely by their
beauty or singularity, it would not be difficult to say
much. Can it be necessary to declaim on the superiority
of a people amongst whom intellectual pleasures,
however trifling, are preferred to mere animal gratifications?
Is it a thing to be lamented that some of the
Spitalfields weavers occupy their leisure hours in searching
for the <i>Adonis</i> butterfly (<i>Polyommatus Adonis</i>), and
others of the more splendid <i>Lepidoptera</i><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, instead of
spending them in playing at skittles or in an alehouse?
Or is there in truth any thing more to be wished than
that the cutlers of Sheffield were accustomed thus to employ
their <i>Saint Mondays</i>; and to recreate themselves
after a hard day's work, by breathing the pure air of
their surrounding hills, while in search of this "untaxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and undisputed game<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>;" and that more of the Norwich
weavers were fond of devoting their vacant time to plant-hunting,
like Joseph Fox recorded by Sir James Smith
as the first raiser of a Lycopodium from seed<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>?</p>

<p>Still more easy is it to advocate the cause of another
description of entomologists&mdash;the general collectors.
These, though not concerning themselves with the system,
contribute most essentially to its advancement. We
cannot expect that princes, noblemen, and others of
high rank or large fortune, who collect insects, should
be able or willing to give up the time necessary for studying
them systematically: but their museums being accessible
to the learned entomologist afford him the use
of treasures which his own limited funds or opportunities
could never have brought together. As to others of less
consequence that content themselves with the title of collectors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
they also have their use. Having devoted themselves
to this one department, they become more expert
at it, than the philosopher who combines deep researches
with the collection of objects; and thus are many species
brought together for the use of the systematist, that would
otherwise remain unknown.</p>

<p>But to proceed to the defence of systematic entomologists.&mdash;These
may be divided into two great classes:
the first comprising those who confine themselves to ascertaining
the names of the insects they collect; the second,
those who, in addition, publish descriptions of
new species; new arrangements of intricate genera; or
extrications of entangled synonyms; and who, in other
respects, actively contribute to the perfection of the
system.</p>

<p>Now with regard to the first class, setting aside what
may be urged in behalf of the study of insects considered
as the work of the Creator, it is easy to show that,
even with such restricted views, their pursuit is as commendable,
and as useful both to themselves and the
community, as many of those on which we look with
the greatest respect. To say the least in their favour, they
amuse themselves innocently, which is quite as much as
can be urged for persons who recreate their leisure hours
with music, painting, or desultory reading. They furnish
themselves with an unfailing provision of that "grand
panacea for the <i>t√¶dium vit√¶</i>"&mdash;employment&mdash;no unimportant
acquisition, when even Gray was forced to exclaim,
with reference to the necessity of "always having
something going forward" towards the enjoyment of life,
"Happy they who can create a rose-tree or erect a honey-suckle;
that can watch the brood of a hen, or see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fleet of their own ducklings launch into the water<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>!"
and like the preceding class, they collect valuable materials
for the use of more active labourers, being thus
at least upon a par with the majority of book-collectors
and antiquaries.</p>

<p>But this is the smallest half of the value of their pursuit.
With what view is the study of the mathematics
so generally recommended? Not certainly for any practical
purpose&mdash;not to make the bulk of those who attend
to them, astronomers or engineers. But simply to exercise
and strengthen the intellect&mdash;to give the mind a
habit of attention and of investigation. Now for all these
purposes, if I do not go so far as to assert that the mere
ascertaining of the names of insects is equal to the study
of the mathematics, I have no hesitation in affirming
that it is nearly as effectual; and with respect to giving
a habit of minute attention, superior. Such is the intricacy
of nature, such the imperfection of our present arrangements,
that the discovery of the name of almost
any insect is a problem, calling in all cases for acuteness
and attention, and in some for a balancing of evidence,
a calculation of the chances of error, as arduous as are
required in a perplexed law-case; and a process of ratiocination
not less strict than that which satisfies the mathematician.
In proof of which assertion I need only
refer any competent judge to the elaborate disquisitions
of Laspeyres, called for by one work alone on the lepidopterous
insects of a single district&mdash;the <i>Wiener Verzeichniss</i>,
which occupy above two hundred octavo
pages<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, and must have cost the learned author nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
as much labour of mind as the <i>Ductor Dubitantium</i> did
Bishop Taylor.</p>

<p>Do not apprehend that this occasional perplexity is
any deduction from the attractions of the science: though
in itself, in some respects, an evil, it forms in fact to
many minds one of the chief of them. The pursuit of
truth, in whatever path, affords pleasure: but the interest
would cease if she never gave us trouble in the
chase. Horace Walpole used to say that from a child
he could never bring himself to attend to any book that
was not full of proper names; and the satisfaction which
he felt in dry investigations concerning noble authors
and obscure painters, is experienced by many an entomologist
who spends hours in disentangling the synonymy
of a doubtful species. Nor would it be easy to prove
that the wordy researches of the one are not to every
practical purpose as valuable as those of the other. We
smile at the Frenchman told of by Menage, that was so
enraptured with the study of heraldry and genealogy, as
to lament the hard case of our forefather Adam, who
could not possibly amuse himself with such investigations<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.
But many an entomologist who has felt the delicious
sensation attendant upon the indisputable ascertainment
of an insect's name after a long search, will feel
inclined to indulge in similar grief for the unhappy lot
of his successors, when all shall be smooth sailing in the
science.</p>

<p>But in behalf of those who are more eminently entitled
to be called entomologists&mdash;those who, not content
with collecting and investigating insects, occupy themselves
in naming and describing such as have been before
unobserved; in instituting new genera or reforming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the old; and, to say all in one word, in perfecting the
system of the science, still higher claims can be urged.
Suppose that at this moment our dictionaries of the
French and German languages were so very defective,
that we were unable by the use of them to profit from
the discoveries of their philosophers; the labours of a
Michaelis being a sealed book to our theologists, and
those of La Place to our astronomers. On this supposition,
would not one of the most important literary undertakings
be the compilation of more perfect dictionaries,
and would not the humblest contributor to such an end
be deemed most meritoriously engaged? Now precisely
what an accurate dictionary of a particular language is
towards enabling the world to participate in the discoveries
published in that language, is a system of Entomology
towards enabling mankind to derive advantage
from any discoveries relative to insects. A good system
of insects containing all the known species, arranged in
appropriate genera, families, orders and classes, is in
fact a dictionary, putting it within our power to ascertain
the name of any given insect, and thus to learn what has
been observed respecting its properties and history as
readily as we determine the meaning of a new word in a
lexicon. In order to impress upon you more forcibly
the absolute need of such a system, I must enter into still
further detail.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a country in which several thousand
insects may not be found. Now, without some scientific
arrangement, how is the observer of a new fact respecting
any one of them, to point out to distant countries
and to posterity the particular insect he had in view?
Suppose an observer in England were to find a certain
beetle which he had demonstrated to be a specific for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
consumption; and that it was necessary that this insect,
which there was reason to believe was common in every
part of the world, should be administered in a recent
state. Would he not be anxious to proclaim the happy
discovery to sufferers in all quarters of the globe? As
his remedy would not admit of transportation, he would
have no other means than by describing it. Now the
question is, whether, on the supposition that no system
of Entomology existed, he would be able to do this, so
as to be intelligible to a physician in North America, for
instance, eager to administer so precious a medicine to
his expiring patient? It would evidently be of no use to
say that the specific was a beetle: there are thousands
of different beetles in North America. Nor would size
or colour be any better guide: there are hundreds of
beetles of the same size and the same colour. Even the
plant on which it fed would be no sufficient clue; for
many insects, resembling each other to an unpractised
eye, feed on the same plant; and the same insect in different
countries feeds upon different plants. His only
resource, then, would be a coloured figure and full description
of it. But every entomologist knows that there
exist insects perfectly distinct, yet so nearly resembling
each other, that no engraving, nor any language other
than that strictly scientific, can possibly discriminate
them. After all, therefore, the chances are, that our
discoverer's remedy, invaluable as it might be, must be
confined to his own immediate neighbourhood, or to
those who came to receive personal information from him.
But with what ease is it made known when a system of
the science exists! If the insect be already described,
he has but to mention its generic and trivial names, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
by aid of two words alone, every entomologist, though
in the most distant region&mdash;whether a Swede, a German,
or a Frenchman; whether a native of Europe, of Asia,
of America, or of Africa, knows instantly the very species
that is meant, and can that moment ascertain whether it
be within his reach. If the species be new and undescribed,
it is only necessary to indicate the genus to
which it belongs, the species to which it is most nearly
allied, and to describe it in scientific terms, which may
be done in few words, and it can at once be recognised
by every one acquainted with the science.</p>

<p>You will think it hardly credible that there should be
so much difficulty in describing an insect intelligibly without
the aid of system; but an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>,
supported by some other facts, will, I conjecture, render
this matter more comprehensible. You have doubtless,
like every one else, in the showery days of summer, felt
no little rage at the <i>flies</i>, which at such times take the
liberty of biting our legs, and contrive to make a comfortable
meal through the interstices of their silken or
cotton coverings. Did it, I pray, ever enter into your
conception, that these blood-thirsty tormentors are a different
species from those flies which you are wont to see
extending the lips of their little proboscis to a piece of
sugar or a drop of wine? I dare say not. But the next
time you have sacrificed one of the former to your just
vengeance, catch one of the latter and compare them. I
question if, after the narrowest comparison, you will not
still venture a wager that they are the very same species.
Yet you would most certainly lose your bet. They are
not even of the same genus&mdash;one belonging to the genus
Musca (<i>M. domestica</i>), and the other to the genus Stomoxys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
(<i>S. calcitrans</i>); and on a second examination you
will find that, however alike in most respects, they differ
widely in the shape of their proboscis; that of the Stomoxys
being a horny sharp-pointed weapon, capable of
piercing the flesh, while the soft blunt organ of the Musca
is perfectly incompetent to any such operation. In future,
while you no longer load the whole race of the house-fly
with the execrations which properly belong to a quite
different tribe, you will cease being surprised that an
ordinary description should be insufficient to discriminate
an insect. It is to this insufficiency that we must attribute
our ignorance of so many of the insects mentioned
by the older naturalists, previously to the systematic improvements
of the immortal Linn√©: and to the same cause
we must refer the impossibility of determining what species
are alluded to in the accounts of many modern travellers
and agriculturists who have been ignorant of Entomology
as a science. Instances without number of
this impossibility might be adduced, but I shall confine
myself to two.</p>

<p>One of the greatest pests of Surinam and other low regions
in South America, is the insect called in the West
Indies, where it is also troublesome, the chigoe (<i>Pulex
penetrans</i>), a minute species, to the attacks of which I
shall again have occasion to advert. This insect is mentioned
by almost all the writers on the countries where it
is found. Not less than eight or ten of them have endeavoured
to give a full description of it, and some of them
have even figured it; and yet, strange to say, it was not
certainly known whether it was a flea (<i>Pulex</i>, L.) or a
mite (<i>Acarus</i>, L.), till a competent naturalist undertook
to investigate its history, and in a short paper in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
<i>Swedish Transactions</i><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> proved that Linn√© was not mistaken
in referring it to the former tribe.</p>

<p>The second instance of the insufficiency of popular
description is even more extraordinary. In 1788 an alarm
was excited in this country by the probability of importing,
in cargoes of wheat from North America, the insect
known by the name of the Hessian fly, whose dreadful
ravages will be adverted to hereafter. However the insect
tribes are in general despised, they had on that occasion
ample revenge. The privy council sat day after
day anxiously debating what measures should be adopted
to ward off the danger of a calamity, more to be
dreaded, as they well knew, than the plague or pestilence.
Expresses were sent off in all directions to the
officers of the customs at the different outports respecting
the examination of cargoes&mdash;dispatches written to the
ambassadors in France, Austria, Prussia, and America,
to gain that information of the want of which they were
now so sensible: and so important was the business
deemed, that the minutes of council and the documents
collected from all quarters fill upwards of two hundred
octavo pages<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. Fortunately England contained one illustrious
naturalist, the most authentic source of information
on all subjects which connect Natural History
with Agriculture and the Arts, to whom the privy council
had the wisdom to apply; and it was by Sir Joseph
Banks's entomological knowledge, and through his suggestions,
that they were at length enabled to form some
kind of judgement on the subject. This judgement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
after all, however, very imperfect. As Sir Joseph Banks
had never seen the Hessian fly, nor was it described in
any entomological system, he called for facts respecting
its nature, propagation, and economy, which could be had
only from America. These were obtained as speedily
as possible, and consist of numerous letters from individuals;
essays from magazines; the reports of the
British minister there, &amp;c. &amp;c. One would have supposed
that from these statements, many of them drawn
up by farmers who had lost entire crops by the insect,
which they profess to have examined in every stage, the
requisite information might have been acquired. So far
however was this from being the case, that many of the
writers seem ignorant whether the insect be a moth, a
fly, or what they term a bug. And though from the concurrent
testimony of several its being a two-winged fly
seemed pretty accurately ascertained, no intelligible description
is given, from which any naturalist can infer to
what genus it belongs, or whether it is a known species.
With regard to the history of its propagation and economy
the statements were so various and contradictory,
that though he had such a mass of materials before him,
Sir Joseph Banks was unable to reach any satisfactory
conclusion.</p>

<p>Nothing can more incontrovertibly demonstrate the
importance of studying Entomology as a science than
this fact. Those observations, to which thousands of unscientific
sufferers proved themselves incompetent, would
have been readily made by one entomologist well versed
in his science. He would at once have determined the
order and genus of the insect, and whether it was a known
or new species; and in a twelvemonth at furthest he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
would have ascertained in what manner it made its attacks,
and whether it were possible that it might be transmitted
along with grain into a foreign country; and on
these solid data he could have satisfactorily pointed out
the best mode of eradicating the pest, or preventing the
extension of its ravages.</p>

<p>But it is not merely in travellers and popular observers
that the want of a systematic knowledge of Entomology
is so deplorable. A great portion of the labours of the
profoundest naturalists has been from a similar cause
lost to the world. Many of the insects concerning which
Reaumur and Bonnet have recorded the most interesting
circumstances, cannot, from their neglect of system, be
at this day ascertained<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. The former, as Beckmann<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
states on the authority of his letters, was before his death
sensible of his great error in this respect: but Bonnet,
with singular inconsistency, constantly maintained the
inutility of system, even on an occasion when, from his
ignorance of it, Sir James Smith, speaking of his experiments
on the barberry, found it quite impossible to make
him comprehend what plant he referred to<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>So great is the importance of a systematic arrangement
of insects. Yet no such arrangement has hitherto
been completed. Various fragments towards it indeed
exist. But the work itself is in the state of a dictionary
wanting a considerable proportion of the words of the
language it professes to explain; and placing those,
which it does contain, in an order often so arbitrary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
defective, that it is difficult to discover even the page containing
the word you are in search of. Can it be denied,
then, that they are most meritoriously employed who devote
themselves to the removal of these defects&mdash;to the
perfecting of the system&mdash;and to clearing the path of future
economical or physiological observers from the obstructions
which now beset it? And who that knows the
vast extent of the science, and how impossible it is that
a divided attention can embrace the whole, will contend
that it is not desirable that some labourers in the field
of literature should devote themselves entirely and exclusively
to this object? Who that is aware of the importance
of the comprehensive views of a Fabricius, an Illiger,
or a Latreille, and the infinite saving of time of
which their inquiries will be productive to their followers,
will dispute their claim to rank amongst the most honourable
in science?</p>

<p>II. No objection, I think, now remains against addicting
ourselves to entomological pursuits, but that which
seems to have the most weight with you, and which indeed
is calculated to make the deepest impression upon
the best minds&mdash;I mean the charge of inhumanity and
cruelty. That the science of Entomology cannot be properly
cultivated without the death of its objects, and that
this is not to be effected without putting them to some
pain, must be allowed; but that this substantiates the
charge of cruelty against us I altogether deny. Cruelty
is an unnecessary infliction of suffering, when a person is
fond of torturing or destroying God's creatures from
mere wantonness, with no useful end in view; or when,
if their death be useful and lawful, he has recourse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
circuitous modes of killing them, where direct ones would
answer equally well. This is cruelty, and this with you
I abominate; but not the infliction of death when a just
occasion calls for it.</p>

<p>They who see no cruelty in the sports of the field, as
they are called, can never, of course, consistently allege
such a charge against the entomologist; the tortures of
wounded birds, of fish that swallow the hook and break
the line, or of the hunted hare, being, beyond comparison,
greater than those of insects destroyed in the usual
mode. With respect to utility, the sportsman, who,
though he adds indeed to the general stock of food, makes
amusement his primary object, must surely yield the
palm to the Entomologist, who adds to the general stock
of mental food, often supplies hints for useful improvements
in the arts and sciences, and the objects of whose
pursuit, unlike those of the former, are preserved and
may be applied to use for many years.</p>

<p>But in the view even of those few who think inhumanity
chargeable upon the sportsman, it will be easy to
place considerations which may rescue the entomologist
from such reproof. It is well known that, in proportion
as we descend in the scale of being, the sensibility of
the objects that constitute it diminishes. The tortoise
walks about after losing its head; and the polypus, so
far from being injured by the application of the knife,
thereby acquires an extension of existence. Insensibility
almost equally great may be found in the insect world.
This, indeed, might be inferred <i>√† priori</i>, since Providence
seems to have been more prodigal of insect life
than of that of any other order of creatures, animalcula
perhaps alone excepted. No part of the creation is exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
to the attack of so many enemies, or subject to so
many disasters; so that the few individuals of each kind
which enrich the valued museum of the entomologist,
many of which are dearer to him than gold or gems, are
snatched from the ravenous maw of some bird or fish or
rapacious insect; would have been driven by the winds
into the waters and drowned; or trodden underfoot by
man or beast,&mdash;for it is not easy, in some parts of the
year, to set foot to the ground without crushing these
minute animals; and thus also, instead of being buried
in oblivion, they have a kind of immortality conferred
upon them. Can it be believed that the beneficent Creator,
whose tender mercies are over all his works, would
expose these helpless beings to such innumerable enemies
and injuries, were they endued with the same sense
of pain and irritability of nerve with the higher orders
of animals?</p>

<p>But this inference is reduced to certainty, when we
attend to the facts which insects every day present to us,
proving that the very converse of our great poet's conclusion,
as usually interpreted,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... The poor beetle that we tread upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when a giant dies,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>must be regarded as nearer the truth<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. Not to mention
the peculiar organization of insects, which strongly favours
the idea I am inculcating, but which will be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
more properly in another place, their sang-froid
upon the loss of their limbs, even those that we account
most necessary to life, irrefragably proves that the pain
they suffer cannot be very acute. Had a giant lost an
arm or a leg, or were a sword or spear run through his
body, he would feel no great inclination for running
about, dancing, or eating. Yet a crane-fly (<i>Tipula</i>) will
leave half its legs in the hands of an unlucky boy who
has endeavoured to catch it, and will fly here and there
with as much agility and unconcern as if nothing had
happened to it; and an insect impaled upon a pin will
often devour its prey with as much avidity as when at
liberty. Were a giant eviscerated, his body divided in
the middle, or his head cut off, it would be all over with
him; he would move no more; he would be dead to the
calls of hunger; or the emotions of fear, anger, or love.
Not so our insects. I have seen the common cock-chafer
walk about with apparent indifference after some bird
had nearly emptied its body of its viscera: a humble-bee
will eat honey with greediness though deprived of
its abdomen; and I myself lately saw an ant, which had
been brought out of the nest by its comrades, walk when
deprived of its head. The head of a wasp will attempt
to bite after it is separated from the rest of the body;
and the abdomen under similar circumstances, if the
finger be moved to it, will attempt to sting. And, what
is more extraordinary, the headless trunk of a male
Mantis has been known to unite itself to the other sex<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
These facts, out of hundreds that might be adduced, are
surely sufficient to prove that insects do not experience
the same acute sensations of pain with the higher orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of animals, which Providence has endowed with more
ample means of avoiding them; and since they were to
be exposed so universally to attack and injury, this is a
most merciful provision in their favour; for, were it
otherwise, considering the wounds, and dismemberments,
and lingering deaths that insects often suffer, what a vast
increase would there be of the general sum of pain and
misery! You will now, I think, allow that the most humane
person need not hesitate a moment, whether he
shall devote himself to the study of Entomology, on account
of any cruelty attached to the pursuit.</p>

<p>But if some morbid sentimentalist should still exclaim,
"Oh! but I cannot persuade myself even for scientific
purposes to inflict the slightest degree of pain upon the
most insensible of creatures&mdash;" Pray, sir or madam, I
would ask, should your green-house be infested by
Aphides, or your grapery by the semianimate Coccus,
would this extreme of tenderness induce you to restrict
your gardener from destroying them? Are you willing
to deny yourself these unnecessary gratifications, and to
resign your favourite flowers and fruit at the call of your
fine feelings? Or will you give up the shrimps, which
by their relish enable you to play a better part with your
bread and butter at breakfast, and thus, instead of adding
to it, contribute to diminish the quantity of food? If
not, I shall only desire you to recollect that, for a mere
personal indulgence, you cause the death of an infinitely
greater number of animals, than all the entomologists in
the world destroy for the promotion of science.</p>

<p>To these considerations, which I have no doubt you
will think conclusive as to the unreasonableness and inconsistency
of the objections made against the study of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Entomology on the score of cruelty, I shall only add
that I do not intend them as any apology for other than
the most speedy and least painful modes of destroying
insects; and these will be pointed out to you in a subsequent
letter. Every degree of unnecessary pain becomes
cruelty, which I need not assure you I abhor; and
from my own observations, however ruthlessly the entomologist
may seem to devote the few specimens wanted
for scientific purposes to destruction, no one in ordinary
circumstances is less prodigal of insect life. For my
own part, I question whether the drowning individuals,
which I have saved from destruction, would not far outnumber
all that I ever sacrificed to science.</p>

<p>My next letter will be devoted to the <i>metamorphoses</i>
of insects, a subject on which some previous explanation
is necessary to enable you to understand those distinctions
between their different states, which will be perpetually
alluded to in the course of our correspondence:
and having thus cleared the way, I shall afterwards proceed
to the consideration of the <i>injuries</i> and <i>benefits</i> of
which insects are the cause.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III">LETTER III.</a></h2>

<h3><i>METAMORPHOSES OF INSECTS.</i></h3>


<p>Were a naturalist to announce to the world the discovery
of an animal which for the first five years of its
life existed in the form of a serpent; which then penetrating
into the earth, and weaving a shroud of pure silk
of the finest texture, contracted itself within this covering
into a body without external mouth or limbs, and resembling
more than any thing else an Egyptian mummy;
and which, lastly, after remaining in this state without
food and without motion for three years longer, should
at the end of that period burst its silken cerements,
struggle through its earthy covering, and start into day
a winged bird,&mdash;what think you would be the sensation
excited by this strange piece of intelligence? After the
first doubts of its truth were dispelled, what astonishment
would succeed! Amongst the learned, what surmises!&mdash;what
investigations! Amongst the vulgar, what
eager curiosity and amazement! All would be interested
in the history of such an unheard-of phenomenon;
even the most torpid would flock to the sight of such a
prodigy.</p>

<p>But you ask, "To what do all these improbable suppositions
tend?" Simply to rouse your attention to the
<i>metamorphoses</i> of the insect world, almost as strange and
surprising, to which I am now about to direct your view,&mdash;miracles,
which, though scarcely surpassed in singularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
by all that poets have feigned, and though actually
wrought every day beneath our eyes, are, because
of their commonness, and the minuteness of the objects,
unheeded alike by the ignorant and the learned.</p>

<p>That butterfly which amuses you with its a√´rial excursions,
one while extracting nectar from the tube of
the honeysuckle, and then, the very image of fickleness,
flying to a rose as if to contrast the hue of its wings with
that of the flower on which it reposes&mdash;did not come
into the world as you now behold it. At its first exclusion
from the egg, and for some months of its existence
afterwards, it was a worm-like caterpillar, crawling upon
sixteen short legs, greedily devouring leaves with two
jaws, and seeing by means of twelve eyes so minute as
to be nearly imperceptible without the aid of a microscope.
You now view it furnished with wings capable
of rapid and extensive flights: of its sixteen feet ten
have disappeared, and the remaining six are in most respects
wholly unlike those to which they have succeeded;
its jaws have vanished, and are replaced by a curled-up
proboscis suited only for sipping liquid sweets; the form
of its head is entirely changed,&mdash;two long horns project
from its upper surface; and, instead of twelve invisible
eyes, you behold two, very large, and composed of at
least twenty thousand convex lenses, each supposed to
be a distinct and effective eye!</p>

<p>Were you to push your examination further, and by
dissection to compare the internal conformation of the
caterpillar with that of the butterfly, you would witness
changes even more extraordinary. In the former you
would find some thousands of muscles, which in the
latter are replaced by others of a form and structure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
entirely different. Nearly the whole body of the caterpillar
is occupied by a capacious stomach. In the butterfly
this has become converted into an almost imperceptible
thread-like viscus; and the abdomen is now
filled by two large packets of eggs, or other organs not
visible in the first state. In the former, two spirally-convoluted
tubes were filled with a silky gum; in the
latter, both tubes and silk have almost totally vanished;
and changes equally great have taken place in the economy
and structure of the nerves and other organs.</p>

<p>What a surprising transformation! Nor was this all.
The change from one form to the other was not direct.
An intermediate state not less singular intervened. After
casting its skin even to its very jaws several times, and
attaining its full growth, the caterpillar attached itself to
a leaf by a silken girth. Its body greatly contracted:
its skin once more split asunder, and disclosed an oviform
mass, without exterior mouth, eyes, or limbs, and
exhibiting no other symptom of life than a slight motion
when touched. In this state of death-like torpor, and
without tasting food, the insect existed for several months,
until at length the tomb burst, and out of a case not
more than an inch long, and a quarter of an inch in diameter,
proceeded the butterfly before you, which covers
a surface of nearly four inches square.</p>

<p>Almost every insect which you see has undergone a
transformation as singular and surprising, though varied
in many of its circumstances. That active little fly, now
an unbidden guest at your table<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, whose delicate palate
selects your choicest viands, one while extending his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
proboscis to the margin of a drop of wine, and then gaily
flying to take a more solid repast from a pear or a peach;
now gamboling with his comrades in the air, now gracefully
currying his furled wings with his taper feet,&mdash;was
but the other day a disgusting grub, without wings,
without legs, without eyes, wallowing, well pleased, in
the midst of a mass of excrement.</p>

<p>The "grey-coated gnat," whose humming salutation,
while she makes her airy circles about your bed, gives
terrific warning of the sanguinary operation in which she
is ready to engage, was a few hours ago the inhabitant
of a stagnant pool, more in shape like a fish than an insect.
Then to have been taken out of the water would
have been speedily fatal; now it could as little exist in
any other element than air. Then it breathed through
its tail; now through openings in its sides. Its shapeless
head, in that period of its existence, is now exchanged
for one adorned with elegantly tufted antenn√¶,
and furnished, instead of jaws, with an apparatus more
artfully constructed than the cupping-glasses of the phlebotomist&mdash;an
apparatus which, at the same time that it
strikes in the lancets, composes a tube for pumping up
the flowing blood.</p>

<p>The "shard-born beetle," whose "sullen horn," as
he directs his "droning flight" close past your ears in
your evening walk, calling up in poetic association the
lines in which he has been alluded to by Shakespear,
Collins, and Gray, was not in his infancy an inhabitant
of air; the first period of his life being spent in gloomy
solitude, as a grub, under the surface of the earth.&mdash;The
shapeless maggot, which you scarcely fail to meet with
in some one of every handful of nuts you crack, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
not always have grovelled in that humble state. If your
unlucky intrusion upon its vaulted dwelling had not left
it to perish in the wide world, it would have continued to
reside there until its full growth had been attained. Then
it would have gnawed itself an opening, and having entered
the earth, and passed a few months in a state of
inaction, would at length have emerged an elegant beetle
furnished with a slender and very long ebony beak: two
wings, and two wing-cases, ornamented with yellow
bands; six feet; and in every respect unlike the worm
from which it proceeded.</p>

<p>That bee&mdash;but it is needless to multiply instances.
A sufficient number has been adduced to show, that the
apparently extravagant supposition with which I set out
may be paralleled in the insect world; and that the metamorphoses
of its inhabitants are scarcely less astonishing
than would be the transformation of a serpent into
an eagle.</p>

<p>These changes I do not purpose explaining minutely in
this place: they will be adverted to more fully in subsequent
letters. Here I mean merely to give you such a
general view of the subject as shall impress you with its
claims to attention, and such an explanation of the states
through which insects pass, and of the different terms
made use of to designate them in each, as shall enable
you to comprehend the frequent allusions which must be
made to them in our future correspondence.</p>

<p>The states through which insects pass are four: the
<i>egg</i>; the <i>larva</i>; the <i>pupa</i>; and the <i>imago</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these need not be here adverted to. In
the <i>second</i>, or immediately after the exclusion from the
egg, they are soft, without wings, and in shape usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
somewhat like worms. This Linn√© called the <i>larva</i>
state, and an insect when in it a <i>larva</i>, adopting a Latin
word signifying a <i>mask</i>, because he considered the real
insect while under this form to be as it were masked.
In the English language we have no common term that
applies to the second state of all insects, though we
have several for that of different tribes. Thus we call
the coloured and often hairy larv√¶ of butterflies and
moths <i>caterpillars</i>; the white and more compact larv√¶
of flies, many beetles, &amp;c. <i>grubs</i> or <i>maggots</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>; and the
depressed larv√¶ of many other insects <i>worms</i>. The
two former terms I shall sometimes use in a similar
sense, rejecting the last, which ought to be confined to
true <i>vermes</i>; but I shall more commonly adopt Linn√©'s
term, and call insects in their second state, <i>larv√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>In this period of their life, during which they eat
voraciously and cast their skin several times, insects
live a shorter or longer period, some only a few days
or weeks, others several months or years. They then
cease eating; fix themselves in a secure place; their
skin separates once more and discloses an oblong body,
and they have now attained the <i>third</i> state of their
existence.</p>

<p>From the swathed appearance of most insects in this
state, in which they do not badly resemble in miniature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a child trussed up like a mummy in swaddling clothes,
according to the barbarous fashion once prevalent here,
and still retained in many parts of the continent; Linn√©
has called it the <i>pupa</i> state, and an insect when under
this form a <i>pupa</i>;&mdash;terms which will be here adopted in
the same sense. In this state, most insects eat no food;
are incapable of locomotion; and if opened seem filled
with a watery fluid, in which no distinct organs can be
traced. Externally, however, the shape of the pup√¶ of
different tribes varies considerably, and different names
have been applied to them.</p>

<p>Those of the beetle and bee tribes are covered with
a membranous skin, inclosing in separate and distinct
sheaths the external organs, as the antenn√¶, legs, and
wings, which are consequently not closely applied to
the body, but have their form for the most part clearly
distinguishable. To these Aristotle originally gave the
name of <i>nymph√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, which was continued by Swammerdam
and other authors prior to Linn√©, who calls them
<i>incomplete</i> pup√¶, and has been adopted by many English
writers on insects<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>Butterflies, moths, and some of the two-winged tribe,
are in their pupa state also inclosed in a similar membranous
envelope; but their legs, antenn√¶, and wings,
are closely folded over the breast and sides; and the
whole body inclosed in a common case or covering of a
more horny consistence, which admits a much less distinct
view of the organs beneath it. As these pup√¶ are often
tinged of a golden colour, they were called from this
circumstance <i>chrysalides</i> by the Greeks, and <i>aureli√¶</i> by
the Romans, both which terms are in some measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
become anglicized; and though not strictly applicable
to ungilded pup√¶, are now often given to those of all
lepidopterous insects<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. These by Linn√© are denominated
<i>obtected</i> pup√¶<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>I have said that <i>most</i> insects eat no food in the pupa
state. This qualification is necessary, because in the
metamorphoses of insects, as in all her other operations,
nature proceeds by measured steps, and a very considerable
number (the tribe of locusts, cockroaches, bugs,
spiders, &amp;c.) not only greatly resemble the perfect insect
in form, but are equally capable with it of eating
and moving. As these insects, however, cast their skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
at stated periods, and undergo changes, though slight,
in their external and internal conformation, they are regarded
also as being subject to metamorphoses. These
pup√¶ may be subdivided into two classes: first, those
comprised, with some exceptions, under the Linnean
<i>Aptera</i>, which in almost every respect resemble the perfect
insect, and were called by Linn√© <i>complete</i> pup√¶;
and secondly, those of the Linnean order <i>Hemiptera</i>,
which resemble the perfect insect, except in having only
the rudiments of wings, and to which the name of <i>semi-complete</i>
pup√¶ was applied by Linn√©, and that of semi-nymphs
by some other authors<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. There is still a fifth
kind of pup√¶, which are not, as in other instances, excluded
from the skin of the larva, but remain concealed
under it, and were hence called by Linn√© <i>coarctate</i> pup√¶.
These, which are peculiar to flies and some other dipterous
genera, may be termed <i>cased-nymphs</i><a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we employ the term <i>pupa</i>, we may
refer indifferently to the third state of any insect, the
particular order being indicated by the context, or an
explanatory epithet. The terms <i>chrysalis</i>, (dropping <i>aurelia</i>,
which is superfluous,) <i>nymph</i>, <i>semi-nymph</i>, and
<i>cased-nymph</i>, on the other hand definitely pointing out
the particular sort of pupa meant: just as in Botany, the
common term <i>pericarp</i> applies to all seed-vessels, the
several kinds being designated by the names of capsule,
silicle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The envelope of <i>cased-nymphs</i>, which is formed of the
skin of the larva, considerably altered in form and texture,
may be conveniently called the <i>puparium</i><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>: but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the artificial coverings of different kinds, whether of silk,
wood, or earth, &amp;c. which many insects of the other
orders fabricate for themselves previously to assuming
the pupa state, and which have been called by different
writers, <i>pods</i>, <i>cods</i>, <i>husks</i>, and <i>beans</i>, I shall continue the
more definite French term <i>cocon</i>, anglicized into <i>cocoon</i><a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>.</p>

<p>After remaining a shorter or longer period, some
species only a few hours, others months, others one or
more years, in the pupa state, the inclosed insect, now
become mature in all its parts, bursts the case which inclosed
it, quits the pupa, and enters upon the fourth and
last state.</p>

<p>We now see it (unless it be an apterous species) furnished
with wings, capable of propagation, and often
under a form altogether different from those which it has
previously borne&mdash;a perfect beetle, butterfly, or other
insect. This Linn√© termed the <i>imago</i> state, and the
animal that had attained to it the <i>imago</i>; because,
having laid aside its <i>mask</i>, and cast off its <i>swaddling
bands</i>, being no longer disguised or confined, or in any
respect imperfect, it is now become a true representative
or <i>image</i> of its species. This state is in general referred
to when an insect is spoken of without the restricting
terms larva or pupa.</p>

<p>Such being the singularity of the transformations of
insects, you will not think the ancients were so wholly
unprovided with a show of argument as we are accustomed
to consider them, for their belief in the possibility
of many of the marvellous metamorphoses which their
poets recount. Utterly ignorant as they were of modern
physiological discoveries, the conversion of a caterpillar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
into a butterfly, must have been a fact sufficient to put to
a nonplus all the sceptical oppugners of such transformations.
And however we may smile in this enlightened
age at the inference drawn not two centuries ago by Sir
Theodore Mayerne, the editor of Mouffet's work on insects,
"that if animals are transmuted so may metals<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>,"
it was not, in fact, with his limited knowledge on these
subjects, so very preposterous. It is even possible that
some of the wonderful tales of the ancients were grafted
on the changes which they observed to take place in insects.
The death and revivification of the ph&#339;nix, from
the ashes of which, before attaining its perfect state, arose
first a <i>worm</i> (&#963;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#951;&#958;), in many of its particulars resembles
what occurs in the metamorphoses of insects. Nor is it
very unlikely that the doctrine of the metempsychosis
took its rise from the same source. What argument
would be thought by those who maintained this doctrine
more plausible in favour of the transmigration of souls,
than the seeming revivification of the dead <i>chrysalis</i>?
What more probable, than that its apparent reassumption
of life should be owing to its receiving for tenant the soul
of some criminal doomed to animate an insect of similar
habits with those which had defiled his human tenement<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>?</p>

<p>At the present day, however, the transformations of
insects have lost that excess of the marvellous, which
might once have furnished arguments for the fictions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the ancients, and the dreams of Paracelsus. We call
them metamorphoses and transformations, because these
terms are in common use, and are more expressive of
the sudden changes that ensue than any new ones. But,
strictly, they ought rather to be termed a series of developments.
A caterpillar is not, in fact, a simple but a
compound animal, containing within it the germ of the
future butterfly, inclosed in what will be the case of the
pupa, which is itself included in the three or more skins,
one over the other, that will successively cover the larva.
As this increases in size these parts expand, present themselves,
and are in turn thrown off, until at length the
perfect insect, which had been concealed in this succession
of masks, is displayed in its genuine form. That
this is the proper explanation of the phenomenon has
been satisfactorily proved by Swammerdam, Malpighi,
and other anatomists. The first-mentioned illustrious
naturalist discovered, by accurate dissections, not only
the skins of the larva and of the pupa incased in each
other, but within them the very butterfly itself, with its
organs indeed in an almost fluid state, but still perfect
in all its parts<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. Of this fact you may convince yourself
without Swammerdam's skill, by plunging into vinegar
or spirit of wine a caterpillar about to assume the pupa
state, and letting it remain there a few days for the purpose
of giving consistency to its parts; or by boiling it
in water for a few minutes. A very rough dissection will
then enable you to detect the future butterfly; and you
will find that the wings, rolled up into a sort of cord, are
lodged between the first and second segment of the caterpillar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
that the antenn√¶ and trunk are coiled up in front
of the head; and that the legs, however different their
form, are actually sheathed in its legs. Malpighi discovered
the eggs of the future moth, in the chrysalis of a
silkworm only a few days old<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, and Reaumur those of
another moth (<i>Hypogymna dispar</i>) even in the caterpillar,
and that seven or eight days before its change into the
pupa<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. A caterpillar, then, may be regarded as a locomotive
egg, having for its embryo the included butterfly,
which after a certain period assimilates to itself the
animal substances by which it is surrounded; has its organs
gradually developed; and at length breaks through
the shell which incloses it.</p>

<p>This explanation strips the subject of every thing miraculous,
yet by no means reduces it to a simple or uninteresting
operation. Our reason is confounded at the
reflection that a larva, at first not thicker than a thread,
includes its own triple, or sometimes octuple, teguments;
the case of a chrysalis, and a butterfly, all curiously folded
in each other; with an apparatus of vessels for breathing
and digesting, of nerves for sensation, and of muscles
for moving; and that these various forms of existence
will undergo their successive evolutions, by aid of a few
leaves received into its stomach. And still less able are
we to comprehend how this organ should at one time be
capable of digesting leaves, at another only honey; how
one while a silky fluid should be secreted, at another
none; or how organs at one period essential to the existence
of the insect, should at another be cast off, and
the whole system which supported them vanish.</p>

<p>Nor does this explanation, though it precludes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
idea of that resemblance, in every particular, which, at
one time, was thought to obtain between the metamorphosis
of insects, especially of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> order,
and the resurrection of the body, do away that general
analogy which cannot fail to strike every one who at
all considers the subject. Even Swammerdam, whose
observations have proved that the analogy is not so
complete as had been imagined, speaking of the metamorphosis
of insects, uses these strong words: "This
process is formed in so remarkable a manner in butterflies,
that we see therein the resurrection painted before
our eyes, and exemplified so as to be examined by our
hands<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>." To see, indeed, a caterpillar crawling upon
the earth, sustained by the most ordinary kinds of food,
which, when it has existed a few weeks or months under
this humble form, its appointed work being finished,
passes into an intermediate state of seeming death, when
it is wound up in a kind of shroud and encased in a
coffin, and is most commonly buried under the earth,
(though sometimes its sepulchre is in the water, and at
others in various substances in the air,) and after this
creature and others of its tribe have remained their destined
time in this death-like state, to behold earth, air,
and water, give up their several prisoners: to survey
them, when, called by the warmth of the solar beam,
they burst from their sepulchres, cast off their cerements,
from this state of torpid inactivity, come forth, as a bride
out of her chamber,&mdash;to survey them, I say, arrayed in
their nuptial glory, prepared to enjoy a new and more
exalted condition of life, in which all their powers are
developed, and they are arrived at the perfection of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
nature; when no longer confined to the earth they can
traverse the fields of air, their food is the nectar of
flowers, and love begins his blissful reign;&mdash;who that
witnesses this interesting scene can help seeing in it a
lively representation of man in his threefold state of existence,
and more especially of that happy day, when at
the call of the great Sun of Righteousness, all that are
in the graves shall come forth, the sea shall give up her
dead, and death being swallowed up of life, the nations
of the blessed shall live and love to the ages of eternity?</p>

<p>But although the analogy between the different states
of insects and those of the body of man is only general,
yet it is much more complete with respect to his soul.
He first appears in this frail body&mdash;a child of the earth,
a crawling worm, his soul being in a course of training
and preparation for a more perfect and glorious existence.
Its course being finished, it casts off the earthy
body, and goes into a hidden state of being in Hades,
where it rests from its works, and is prepared for its
final consummation. The time for this being arrived,
it comes forth clothed with a glorious body, not like its
former, though germinating from it, for though "it was
sown an animal body, it shall be raised a spiritual body,"
endowed with augmented powers, faculties and privileges
commensurate to its new and happy state. And here
the parallel holds perfectly between the insect and the
man. The butterfly, the representative of the soul, is
prepared in the <i>larva</i> for its future state of glory; and if
it be not destroyed by the ichneumons and other enemies
to which it is exposed, symbolical of the vices that
destroy the spiritual life of the soul, it will come to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
state of repose in the <i>pupa</i>, which is its Hades; and at
length, when it assumes the <i>imago</i>, break forth with new
powers and beauty to its final glory and the reign of
love. So that in this view of the subject well might the
Italian poet exclaim:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non v' accorgete voi, che noi siam' vermi<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nati a formar l' angelica farfalla<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Egyptian fable, as it is supposed to be, of Cupid
and Psyche, seems built upon this foundation. "Psyche,"
says an ingenious and learned writer, "means in Greek
the human soul; and it means also a butterfly<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, of which
apparently strange double sense the undoubted reason is,
that a butterfly was a very ancient symbol of the soul&mdash;from
the prevalence of this symbol, and the consequent
coincidence of the names, it happened that the Greek
sculptors frequently represented Psyche as subject to
Cupid in the shape of a butterfly; and that even when
she appears in their works under the human form, we
find her decorated with the light and filmy wings of that
gay insect<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>."</p>

<p>The following beautiful little poem falls in so exactly
with the subject I have been discussing, that I cannot
resist the temptation I feel to copy it for you, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
as I am not aware that it has appeared any where but in
a newspaper.</p>

<p>A question here naturally presents itself&mdash;Why are
insects subject to these changes? For what end is it
that, instead of preserving like other animals<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the same
general form from infancy to old age, they appear at one
period under a shape so different from that which they
finally assume; and why should they pass through an
intermediate state of torpidity so extraordinary? I can
only answer that such is the will of the Creator, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
doubtless had the wisest ends in view, although we are
incompetent satisfactorily to discover them. Yet one
reason for this conformation may be hazarded. A very
important part assigned to insects in the economy of
nature, as I shall hereafter show, is that of speedily removing
superabundant and decaying animal and vegetable
matter. For such agents an insatiable voracity is
an indispensable qualification, and not less so unusual
powers of multiplication. But these faculties are in a
great degree incompatible. An insect occupied in the
work of reproduction could not continue its voracious
feeding. Its life, therefore, after leaving the egg, is divided
into three stages. In the first, as <i>larva</i>, it is in a
state of sterility; its sole object is the satisfying its insatiable
hunger; and, for digesting the masses of food
which it consumes, its intestines are almost all stomach.
This is usually by much the longest period of its existence.
Having now laid up a store of materials for
the development of the future perfect insect, it becomes
a <i>pupa</i>; and during this inactive period the important
process slowly proceeds, uninterrupted by the calls of
appetite. At length the perfect insect is disclosed. It
now often requires no food at all; and scarcely ever
more than a very small quantity; for the reception of
which its stomach has been contracted, in some instances,
to a tenth of its former bulk. Its almost sole object is
now the multiplication of its kind, from which it is diverted
by no other propensity; and this important duty
being performed, the end of its existence has been answered,
and it expires.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that some objections might be
thrown out against this hypothesis, yet I think none that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
would not admit of a plausible answer. To these it is
foreign to my purpose now to attend, and I shall conclude
this letter by pointing out to you the variety of
new relations which this arrangement introduces into
nature. One individual unites in itself, in fact, three
species, whose modes of existence are often as different
as those of the most distantly related animals of other
tribes. The same insect often lives successively in three
or four worlds. It is an inhabitant of the water during
one period; of the earth during another; and of the air
during a third; and fitted for its various abodes by new
organs and instruments, and a new form in each. Think
(to use an illustration of Bonnet) but of the cocoon of
the silkworm! How many hands, how many machines
does not this little ball put into motion! Of what riches
should we not have been deprived, if the moth of the
silkworm had been born a moth, without having been
previously a caterpillar! The domestic economy of a large
portion of mankind would have been formed on a plan
altogether different from that which now prevails.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_IV" id="LETTER_IV">LETTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3><i>INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>DIRECT INJURIES.</h5>


<p>In the letter which I devoted to the defence of Entomology,
I gave you reason to expect, more effectually to
obviate the objection drawn from the supposed insignificance
of insects, that I should enter largely into the question
of their importance to us both as instruments of good
and evil. This I shall now attempt; and, as I wish to
leave upon your mind a pleasant impression with respect
to my favourites, I shall begin with the last of these subjects&mdash;the
<i>injury</i> which they do to us.</p>

<p>The Almighty ordains various instruments for the
punishment of offending nations: sometimes he breaks
them to pieces with the iron rod of war; at others the
elements are let loose against them; earthquakes and
floods of fire, at his word, bring sudden destruction upon
them; seasons unfriendly to vegetation threaten them
with famine; the blight and mildew realize these threats;
and often, the more to manifest and glorify his power,
he employs means, at first sight, apparently the most insignificant
and inadequate to effect their ruin; the numerous
tribes of <i>insects</i> are his armies<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, marshalled by
him, and by his irresistible command impelled to the
work of destruction: where he directs them they lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
waste the earth, and famine and the pestilence often follow
in their train.</p>

<p>The generality of mankind overlook or disregard these
powerful, because minute, dispensers of punishment;
seldom considering in how many ways their welfare is
affected by them: but the fact is certain, that should it
please God to give them a general commission against
us, and should he excite them to attack, at the same time,
our bodies, our clothing, our houses, our cattle, and the
produce of our fields and gardens, we should soon be
reduced, in every possible respect, to a state of extreme
wretchedness; the prey of the most filthy and disgusting
diseases, divested of a covering, unsheltered, except by
caves and dungeons, from the inclemency of the seasons,
exposed to all the extremities of want and famine; and
in the end, as Sir Joseph Banks, speaking on this subject,
has well observed<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>, driven with all the larger animals
from the face of the earth. You may smile, perhaps,
and think this a high-coloured picture, but you will recollect&mdash;I
am not stating the mischiefs that insects commonly
do, but what they would do according to all probability,
if certain counter-checks restraining them within
due limits had not been put in action; and which they
actually do, as you will see, in particular cases, when
those counter-checks are diminished or removed.</p>

<p>Insects may be said, without hyperbole, to have established
a kind of universal empire over the earth and its
inhabitants. This is principally conspicuous in the injuries
which they occasion, for nothing in nature that possesses
or has possessed animal or vegetable life, is safe
from their inroads. Neither the cunning of the fox, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the swiftness of the horse or deer, nor the strength of the
buffalo, nor the ferocity of the lion or tiger, nor the armour
of the rhinoceros, nor the giant bulk or sagacity
of the elephant, nor even the authority of imperial man,
who boasts himself to be the lord of all, can secure them
from becoming a prey to these despised beings. The
air affords no protection to the birds, nor the water to
the fish; insects pursue them all to their most secret
conclaves and strongest citadels, and compel them to
submit to their sway. Flora's empire is still more exposed
to their cruel domination and ravages; and there is
scarcely one of her innumerable subjects, from the oak,
the glory of the forest, to the most minute lichen that
grows upon its trunk, that is not destined to be the food
of these next to nonentities in our estimation. And when
life departs from man, the inferior animals, or vegetables,
they become universally, sooner or later, the inheritance
of insects.</p>

<p>I shall principally bespeak your attention to the injuries
in question as they affect ourselves. These may be
divided into direct and indirect. By <i>direct</i> injuries I
mean every species of attack upon our own persons, and
by <i>indirect</i>, such as are made upon our property. To
the former of these I shall confine myself in the present
letter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Insects, as to their <i>direct</i> attacks upon us, may be arranged
in three principal classes. Those, namely, which
seek to make us their food; those whose object is to
prevent or revenge an injury which they either fear, or
have received from us; and those which indeed offer us no
violence, but yet incommode us extremely in other ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope I shall not too much offend your delicacy if I
begin the first class of our insect assailants with a very
disgusting genus, which Providence seems to have created
to punish inattention to personal cleanliness. But though
this pest of man must not be wholly passed over, yet,
since it is unfortunately too well known, it will not be at
all necessary for me to enlarge upon its history. I shall
only mention one fact which shows the astonishingly rapid
increase of these animals, where they have once gotten
possession. It is a vulgar notion, that a louse in twenty-four
hours may see two generations; but this is rather
overshooting the mark. Leeuwenhoek, whose love for
science overcame the nausea that such creatures are apt
to excite, proves that their nits or eggs are not hatched
till the eighth day after they are laid, and that they do
not themselves commence laying before they are a month
old. He ascertained, however, that a single female louse
may, in eight weeks, witness the birth of five thousand
descendants<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. You remember how wolves were extirpated
from this country, but perhaps never suspected any
monarch of imposing a tribute of <i>lice</i> upon his subjects.
Yet we are gravely told that in Mexico and Peru such a
<i>poll</i>-tax was exacted, and that bags full of these treasures
were found in the palace of Montezuma<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>!!! Were our
own taxes paid in such coin, what little grumbling would
there be!</p>

<p>Two other species of this genus, besides the common
louse, are, in this country, parasites upon the human
body&mdash;&mdash;But already I seem to hear you exclaim, "Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
dwell so long on creatures so odious and nauseating,
whose injuries are confined to the <i>profanum vulgus</i>?
Leave them therefore to the canaille&mdash;they are nothing
to us." Not so fast, my friend&mdash;recollect what historians
and other writers have recorded concerning the <i>Phthiriasis</i>
or pedicular disease, and you must own that, for
the quelling of human pride, and to pull down the high
conceits of mortal man, this most loathsome of all maladies,
or one equally disgusting, has been the inheritance
of the rich, the wise, the noble, and the mighty; and in
the list of those that have fallen victims to it, you will
find poets, philosophers, prelates, princes, kings, and
emperors. It seems more particularly to have been a
judgement of God upon oppression and tyranny, whether
civil or religious. Thus the inhuman Pheretima mentioned
by Herodotus, Antiochus Epiphanes, the Dictator
Sylla, the two Herods, the Emperor Maximin, and,
not to mention more, the great persecutor of the Protestants,
Philip the Second, were carried off by it.</p>

<p>I say by this malady, <i>or one equally disgusting</i>, because
it is not by any means certain, though some learned
men have so supposed, that all these instances, and
others of a similar nature, standing also upon record,
are to be referred to the same specific cause; since there
is very sufficient reason for thinking that at least <i>three</i>
different descriptions of insects are concerned in the various
cases that have been handed down to us under the
common name of <i>Phthiriasis</i>. As the subject of maladies
connected with insects, or produced by them, is both curious
and interesting, although no writer, that I am
aware of, has given it full consideration, and at the same
time falls in with my general design, I hope you will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
regard me as guilty of presumption, and of intruding
into the province of medical men, if I enter rather largely
into it, and state to you the reasons that have induced
me to embrace the above hypothesis, leaving you full
liberty to reject it if you do not find it consonant to reason
and fact. The three kinds of insects to which I allude,
as concerned in cases that have been deemed Phthiriasis,
are lice (<i>Pediculi</i>, L.) mites (<i>Acari</i>, L.), and <i>Larv√¶</i> in
general.</p>

<p>As far as the habits of the genus <i>Pediculus</i>, whether
inhabiting man or the inferior animals, are at present
known, it does not appear, from any well ascertained fact,
that the species belonging to it are ever <i>subcutaneous</i>.
For this observation, as far as it relates to man, I can
produce the highest medical authority. "The louse feeds
on the surface of the skin," says the learned Dr. Mead
in his <i>Medica Sacra</i>; and Dr. Willan, in his palmary
work on <i>Cutaneous Diseases</i>, remarks with respect to the
body-louse, "that the nits, or eggs, are deposited on the
small hairs of the skin," and that "the animals are found
on the skin, or on the linen, and not under the cuticle,
as some authors have represented." And he further observes,
that "many marvellous stories are related by Forestus,
Schenkius and others respecting lice bred under
the skin, and discharged in swarms from abscesses, strumous
ulcers, and vesications. The mode in which Pediculi
are generated being now so well ascertained, no
credit can be given to these accounts." Thus far this
great man, who however supposes (in which opinion Dr.
Bateman concurs with him) that the authors to whom he
alludes had mistaken for lice some other species of insects,
which are not unfrequently found in putrefactive sores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>If these observations be allowed their due weight, it
will follow, that a disease produced by animals residing
under the cuticle cannot be a true Phthiriasis, and therefore
the death of the poet Alcman, and of Pherecydes
Syrius the philosopher, mentioned by Aristotle, must
have been occasioned by some other kind of insect. For,
speaking of the lice to which he attributes these catastrophes,
he says that "they are produced in the flesh in
small pustule-like tumours, which have no pus, and from
which when punctured, they issue<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>." For the same
reason, the disorder which Dr. Heberden has described
in his <i>Commentaries</i>, from the communications of Sir
E. Wilmot, under the name of <i>Morbus pedicularis</i>, must
also be a different disease, since, with Aristotle, he likewise
represents the insects as inhabiting tumours, from
which they may be extracted when opened by a needle.
He says, indeed, that in every respect they resemble the
common lice, except in being whiter; but medical men,
who were not at the same time entomologists, might easily
mistake an Acarus for a Pediculus<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Willan, in one case of <i>Prurigo senilis</i>, observed a
number of small insects on the patient's skin and linen.
They were quick in their motion, and so minute that it
required some attention to discover them. He took them
at first for small Pediculi; but under a lens they appeared
to him rather to be a nondescript species of Pulex<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>; yet
the figure he gives has not the slightest likeness to the
latter genus, while it bears a striking resemblance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
former. It is not clear whether his draughtsman meant
to represent the insect with six or with eight legs: if it
had only six, it was probably a Pediculus; but if it had
eight, it would form a new genus between the <i>Acarina</i>
and the hexapod <i>Aptera</i>. Dr. Bateman, in reply to some
queries put to him, at my request, by our common and
lamented friend Dr. Reeve, relates that he understood
from Dr. Willan, in conversation, that the insect in question
jumped in its motion. This circumstance he regards
as conclusive against its being a Pediculus; but such a
consequence does not necessarily follow, since it not seldom
happens that insects of the same tribe or genus
either have or have not this faculty; for instance, compare
<i>Scirtes</i> with <i>Cyphon</i>, small beetles, and <i>Acarus Scabiei</i>
with other <i>Acari</i><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Willan has quoted with approbation two cases from
Amatus Lusitanus, which he seems to think correctly described
as Phthiriasis. In one of them, however, which
terminated fatally, the circumstances seem rather hyperbolically
stated&mdash;I mean, where it is said that two black
servants had no other employment than carrying baskets
full of these insects to the sea!! Perhaps you will think
I draw largely upon your credulity if I call upon you to
believe this; I shall therefore leave you to act as you
please.&mdash;Thus much for pure Phthiriasis, which term
ought to be confined to maladies produced by <i>lice</i>. I
shall only further observe, that as many species as exist
of these, which are the causes of disease, so many kinds
of Phthiriasis will there be.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Acari</i>, or mites, are the next insect sources of disease
in the human species, and that not of one, but probably
of many kinds both local and general. They are distinguished
from Pediculi not only by their form, but also
often by their situation, since they frequently establish
themselves under the cuticle. With respect to local disorders,
Dr. Adams conjectures that Acari may be the
cause of certain cases of <i>Ophthalmia</i>. Sir J. Banks, in
a letter to that gentleman, relates that some seamen belonging
to the Endeavour brig, being tormented with a
severe itching round the extremities of the eyelids, one
of them was cured by an Otaheitan woman, who with
two small splinters of bamboo extracted from between
the <i>cilia</i> abundance of very minute lice, which were
scarcely visible without a lens, though their motion, when
laid on the thumb, was distinctly perceived. These insects
were probably synonymous with the <i>Ciron des paupi√®res</i>
of Sauvages<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.&mdash;Le Jeune, a French physician
quoted in Mouffet, describes a case, in which what seems
a different species, since he calls them rather large, infested
the white of the eye, exciting an intolerable itching<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.&mdash;Dr.
Mead, from the <i>German Ephemerides</i>, gives
an account of a woman suckling her child, from whose
breast proceeded very minute vermicles<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. These were
probably mites, and perhaps that species, which, from
its feeding upon milk, Linn√© denominates <i>Acarus Lactis</i>.
The great author last mentioned describes an insect, a
native of America, under the name of <i>Pediculus Ricinoides</i>,
which, upon the authority of Rolander, he informs us,
gets into the feet of people as they walk, sucks their blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
oviposits<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> in them, and so occasions very dangerous
ulcers. It would be an Acarus, he observes, but it has
only six legs. Now Hermann affirms, that some species
of <i>Trombidium</i> (a genus separated by Fabricius from
<i>Acarus</i>) have in no state more than six legs<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. Others of
the tribe of <i>Acarina</i>, and the insect in question amongst
the rest, may be similarly circumstanced; or those that
Rolander examined might have been larv√¶, which in this
tribe are usually hexapods.</p>

<p>Linn√© appears to have been of opinion that many contagious
diseases are caused by mites<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. How far he was
justified in this opinion I shall not here inquire; facts
alone can decide the question, and observations made by
men acquainted with Entomology as well as the science
of diseases. Considerable deference and attention, however,
are certainly due to the sentiments of so great a
naturalist, in whom these necessary qualifications were
united in no common degree. With respect to the dysentery
and the itch, he affirms that this had been manifested
to his eyes. You will wish probably to know the
arguments that may be adduced in confirmation of this
opinion; I will therefore endeavour to satisfy you as well
as I am able. The following history given by Linn√© seems
to prove the dysentery connected with these animals.</p>

<p>Rolander, a student in Entomology, while he resided
in the house of the illustrious Swede, was attacked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
disease in question, which quickly gave way to the usual
remedies. Eight days after, it returned again, and was
as before soon removed. A third time, at the end of the
same period, he was seized with it. All the while he had
been living like the rest of the family, who had nevertheless
escaped. This, of course, occasioned no little inquiry
into the cause of what had happened. Linn√©, aware that
Bartholinus had attributed the dysentery to <i>insects</i>,
which he professed to have seen, recommended it to his pupil
to examine his feces. Rolander, following this advice,
discovered in them innumerable animalcules, which upon
a close examination proved to be mites. It was next a
question how he alone came to be singled out by them;
and thus he accounts for it. It was his habit not to drink
at his meals; but in the night, growing thirsty, he often
sipped some liquid out of a vessel made of juniper wood.
Inspecting this very narrowly, he observed, in the chinks
between the ribs, a white line, which, when viewed under
a lens, he found to consist of innumerable mites, precisely
the same with those that he had voided. Various
experiments were tried with them, and a preparation of
rhubarb was found to destroy them most effectually. He
afterwards discovered them in vessels containing acids,
and often under the bung of casks<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. In the instance
here recorded, the dysentery, or diarrh&#339;a, was evidently
produced by a species of mite, which Linn√© hence called
<i>Acarus Dysenteri√¶</i>; but it would be going too far, I apprehend,
to assert that they are invariably the cause of
that disease.</p>

<p>That <i>Scabies</i>, or the itch, is occasioned by a mite, is
not a doctrine peculiar to the moderns. Mouffet mentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Abinzoar, called also Avenzoar, a celebrated Hispano-Arabian
physician of Seville, who flourished in the
twelfth century, as the most ancient author that notices
it. He calls these mites little lice that creep under the
skin of the hands, legs, and feet, exciting pustules full of
fluid<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Joubert, quoted by the same author, describes
them under the name of <i>Sirones</i>, as always being concealed
beneath the epidermis, under which they creep
like moles, gnawing it, and causing a most troublesome
itching. It appears that Mouffet, or whoever was the
author of that part of the <i>Theatrum Insectorum</i>, was himself
also well acquainted with these animals, since he remarks
that their habitation is not in the pustule but near
it: a remark afterwards confirmed by Linn√©<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>, and more
recently by Dr. Adams<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. In common with the former
of these authors, Mouffet further notices the effect of
warmth upon them in exciting motion<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. Our intelligent
countryman also observes that they cannot be Pediculi,
since they live under the cuticle, which lice never do<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.
In the epistle dedicatory, the editor speaks also of them
as living in burrows which they have excavated in the
skin near a lake of water; from which if they be extracted
with a needle and put upon the nail, they show
in the sun their red head and the feet with which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
walk<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. And to close my <i>veteran</i> authorities, Junius thus
explains the word Acarus, as I find him quoted in Gouldman's
useful dictionary, "A small worm, which eats under
the skin, and makes burrows in itching hands<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>."</p>

<p>In more modern times, microscopical figures have been
added to descriptions of the insect. Bonomo first furnished
this valuable species of elucidation. His figures,
however, which are copied by Baker in his work on the
microscope, are far from accurate<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. Those of De Geer
and Dr. Adams are much more satisfactory, and mutually
confirm each other<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. From them it is evident that the
same insect inhabits the scabies of Sweden and Madeira.
Dr. Bateman, in the letter before alluded to, informs his
correspondent, that he had seen that from Madeira, and
gives it as his opinion, that there cannot be a doubt of
the existence of an <i>Acarus Scabiei</i>; an opinion which
he repeats in his late work on <i>Cutaneous Diseases</i>; and
which, according to Hermann<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>, has been also rendered
unquestionable by Wichmann in his <i>Etiologie de la Gale</i>
(Hanovre 1786), a work I have not had an opportunity
of consulting. From all this we may regard the point
as so far settled, that an animal of this kind exists at
least as an occasional concomitant of scabies.</p>

<p>This fact being ascertained, a more complex inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
remains, which branches out into two distinct questions.
Is scabies always produced by these insects? Or, if this
be not the case, Is the <i>animate</i> scabies a distinct disease
from the <i>inanimate</i>?</p>

<p>It is very remarkable that Linn√©, a physician as well
as a naturalist; and De Geer, one of the most accurate
observers that ever existed; should both assign the insect
in question as the undoubted cause of the <i>common</i> scabies
of their country; the one applying to the disease he was
speaking of the epithet of <i>communissima</i>, and observing
the fact to be notorious, (<i>cuique liquet</i>,) and the other designating
it by its well known French name "<i>La Gale</i><a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>."
And is it not equally remarkable that such men as John
Hunter, Dr. Heberden, Dr. Bateman, Dr. Adams, and
Mr. Baker, should never, in this country, have been able
to meet with it? Did it indeed exist in our common scabies,
it seems impossible that it could have escaped the
observation of the two last of these gentlemen; Dr. Adams
being so well qualified to detect it from his observations
in Madeira, and Mr. Baker from his expertness in microscopical
researches. Dr. Bateman, in the letter above
quoted, says, "I have hunted it with a good magnifier,
in many cases of itch, both in and near the pustules, and
in the red streaks or furrows, but always without success."
In his work on <i>Cutaneous Diseases</i> he tells us, however,
that he has seen it, in one instance, when it had been
taken from the diseased surface by another practitioner.
And though Dr. Willan in his book speaks of the Acarus
as the concomitant of this disease, yet his learned friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
just mentioned observes, that he admitted that it was not
to be found in ordinary cases, and indeed never seemed
to have made up his mind upon the subject. When I
was at Norwich in 1812, Dr. Reeve very kindly accompanied
me to the House of Industry there, to examine
a patient whose body was very full of the pustules of this
disorder; but though we used a good magnifier, we
could discover nothing like an insect. I must observe,
however, that our examination was made in December,
in severe weather, when the cold might, perhaps, render
the animal torpid, and less easy to be discovered.</p>

<p>From the above facts it seems fair to infer that this
animal is not invariably the cause of scabies, but that
there are cases with which it has no connexion. Now,
from this inference, would not another also follow, that
the disease produced by the insect is specifically distinct
from that in which it cannot be found? Sauvages and
Dr. Adams are both of this opinion<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>, the former assigning
to it the trivial name of <i>vermicularis</i>; and the latter
proving, by very satisfactory arguments, that it is different
from the other. If they were both <i>animate</i> diseases, but
derived from two distinct species of animals, (for it seems
not impossible that even our common itch may be caused
by a mite more minute than the other, and so more difficult
to find,) they would properly be considered as
distinct species; much more, therefore, if one be <i>animate</i>
and the other <i>inanimate</i>. Nay this, I should think, would
lead to a doubt whether even their <i>genus</i> were the same.
I shall dismiss this part of my subject with the mention
of a discovery of Dr. Adams, which seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
escaped both Linn√© and De Geer&mdash;that the <i>Acarus Scabiei</i>
is endowed with the faculty of leaping; (in this respect
resembling the insect found by Willan in <i>Prurigo senilis</i>
mentioned above;) for which purpose its four posterior
thighs are incrassated<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>But besides these <i>Acarine</i> diseases, there seems to be
one (unless with Linn√© we regard the plague as of this
class<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>) more fearful and fatal than them all. You will,
perhaps, conjecture I am speaking of that described by
Aristotle and Sir E. Wilmot as the Phthiriasis, and your
conjecture will be right. But some think, and those men
of merited celebrity, that <i>mites</i> have nothing to do in
these and similar cases, for that <i>maggots</i> were the parasites
mistaken for lice. This, from the passage above
quoted, appears to have been Dr. Willan's opinion, to
which, in the letter so often referred to, Dr. Bateman
subscribes; adding as a reason for excluding mites from
being concerned, that "they are too minute, and never
have been seen in such numbers as to be mistaken for
lice." But both vary in size, some of the former being
larger than some of the latter. And allowing them to
be ever so minute, yet when they issue in swarms, as
mites from a cheese, they would be very visible, were it
only from their motion. Besides, as they are furnished
with legs, their motions resemble those of lice infinitely
more than do the contortions of maggots. So that a
mite would be deemed a louse much sooner by an unentomological
observer than would a maggot. Whether
mites have ever been seen in such numbers as to be mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
for lice, is the point in question; and therefore,
by itself, cannot be admitted for a valid argument.
Though <i>Acarus Scabiei</i> does not appear to swarm in
ordinary cases, yet this is certainly no reason why other
species may not do so. Where it has once made a
settlement, how incredibly, and in how short a space
of time, does the <i>Siro</i> or cheese-mite multiply! <i>Acarus
Destructor</i> and many other species are equally rapid in
their increase.&mdash;Millions of lice are said by Lafontaine,
whom Hermann calls a very exact describer, to show
themselves in <i>Plica polonica</i>, on the third day of the disease<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>;
but whether the last-mentioned author be correct
in thinking it more probable that they are mites<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>, I have
not the means of judging.</p>

<p>I shall now produce two instances where mites were
evidently concerned. Dr. Mead, from the <i>German Ephemerides</i>,
relates the miserable case of a French nobleman,
from whose eyes, nostrils, mouth, and urinary passage
animalcules of a red colour, and excessively minute,
broke forth day and night, attended by the most horrible
and excruciating pains, and at length occasioned his
death. The account further says, that they were produced
from his corrupted blood. This was probably a
fancy originating in their red colour: but the whole history,
whether we consider the size and colour of the animals,
or the places from which they issue, is inapplicable
to <i>larv√¶</i> or maggots, and agrees very well with <i>mites</i>,
some of which, particularly <i>Leptus autumnalis</i>, are of a
bright red colour. The other case, and a very similar
one, is that recorded by Mouffet of Lady Penruddock;
concerning whom he expressly tells us, that Acari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
swarmed in every part of her body&mdash;her head, eyes, nose,
lips, gums, the soles of her feet, &amp;c., tormenting her day
and night, till, in spite of every remedy, all the flesh of
her body being consumed, she was at length relieved by
death from this terrible state of suffering. Mouffet attributes
her disease to the <i>Acarus Scabiei</i>; but from the symptoms
and fatal result it seems to have been a different
and much more terrific animal. He supposes, in this
instance, the insect to have been generated by drinking
goat's milk too copiously. This, if correct, would lead to
a conjecture that it might have been the <i>A. Lactis</i>, L.</p>

<p>These cases I hope will satisfy you that mites, as well
as lice, are the cause of diseases in the human frame.
This, indeed, as has been before observed, is allowed on
all hands with respect to that of the itch; and it is, certainly,
not more improbable that man should be exposed
to the attack of several species of this genus, than that
three or four kinds of Pediculus should infest him. If
you are convinced by what I have written, you will concur
with me in thinking that the one are as much entitled
to give their name to the disease which they produce
as the other; and the term <i>Acariasis</i>, by which,
with due deference to medical men, I propose to distinguish
generically all acarine diseases, will not be refused
its place amongst your <i>Genera Morborum</i>.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to the remaining class of diseases
mistaken for Phthiriasis; those, namely, which are produced
by <i>larv√¶</i>. There are two terms employed by ancient
authors, <i>Eul√¶</i> (&#917;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#953;) and <i>Scolex</i> (&#931;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#951;&#958;), which
seem properly to denote larv√¶; but there is often such a
want of precision in the language of writers unacquainted
with Natural History, that it is very difficult to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
out what objects they mean; and expressions which,
strictly taken, should be understood of larv√¶, may probably
sometimes have been used to denote the cause of
either the pedicular or acarine disease. <i>Eul√¶</i>, which
term, though given by Hesychius as synonymous with
<i>Scolex</i>, is by Plutarch used as of different import<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>, seems
properly to mean those larv√¶ which are generated in
dead carcases, at least so Homer has more than once
applied it<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>: it is therefore a word of a much more restricted
sense than <i>Scolex</i>, which probably belongs to the
larv√¶ of every order of insects; for so Aristotle employs
it, when he says that all insects produce a <i>Scolex</i>, or are
larviparous<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. Yet when Homer compares Harpalion
stretched dead upon the ground to a <i>Scolex</i><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>, it should
seem as if he used the word for an earth-worm, which
Aristotle commonly calls by a figurative periphrasis,
"Entrails of the earth<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>." In the Holy Scriptures this
word is used to signify larv√¶ which prey upon and are
the torment of living bodies<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>. It may on this account,
perhaps, be regarded as generally meaning such larv√¶,
to whatever order or genus they belong.</p>

<p>Dr. Mead, therefore, is most probably right when he
considers the disease stated by the ancients to be caused
by <i>Eul√¶</i> or <i>Scoleches</i>, commonly translated worms, as
distinct from Phthiriasis; and if so, the inhuman Pheretima,
who swarmed with <i>Eul√¶</i>, and Herod Agrippa,
who was eaten of <i>Scoleches</i><a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>, were probably neither of
them destroyed either by Pediculi or Acari, but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
larv√¶ or maggots. And when Galen prescribed a remedy
for ulcers inhabited by <i>Scoleches</i>, observing that
animals similar to those generated by putrid substances
are often found in abscesses, he probably meant the same
thing. The proper appellation of this genus of diseases
would be <i>Scolechiasis</i>.</p>

<p>This dissertation may perhaps appear to you rather
prolix and tedious: yet to settle the meaning of terms is
of the first importance. To inquire what ancient writers
intended by the words which they employ, and whether
such as have been usually regarded as synonymous are
really so, may often furnish us with a clue to some useful
or interesting truth; and not seldom enable us to rescue
their reputation from much of the censure which has been
inconsiderately cast upon it. Because they did not know
every thing, or so much as we do, we are too apt to think
that they knew nothing. That they fell into very considerable
errors, especially in subjects connected with
Natural History, cannot be denied; but then it ought
to be considered that they possessed scarcely any of
those advantages by which we are enabled to penetrate
into nature's secrets. The want of the microscope alone
was an effectual bar to their progress in this branch of
science. Yet, in some instances, when they took a general
view of a subject, they appear to have had very
correct ideas. This observation particularly applies to
the philosopher of Stagyra, whose mighty mind and
lyncean eye, in spite of those mists of prejudice and fable
that enveloped the age in which he lived, enabled him in
part to pierce through the gloom, and comprehend and
behold the fair outline that gives symmetry, grace and
beauty to the whole of nature's form, though he mistook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
or was not able to trace out, her less prominent features
and minor lineaments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is now time to return from this long digression,
which however is closely connected with the subject of
this letter, to the point from which I deviated. Taking
my leave of the disgusting animals which gave rise to it,
I proceed to call your attention to another of our pygmy
tormentors, (<i>Pulex irritans</i>,) which, in the opinion of
some, seems to have been regarded as an agreeable
rather than a repulsive object. "Dear miss," said a
lively old lady to a friend of mine, (who had the misfortune
to be confined to her bed by a broken limb, and was
complaining that the fleas tormented her,) "don't you
like <i>fleas</i>? Well, I think they are the prettiest little
merry things in the world.&mdash;I never saw a dull flea in
all my life." The celebrated Willughby kept a favourite
flea, which used at stated times to be admitted to suck
the palm of his hand; and enjoyed this privilege for three
months, when the cold killed it. And Dr. Townson, from
the encomium which he bestows upon these vigilant little
vaulters, as supplying the place of an alarum and driving
us from the bed of sloth, should seem to have regarded
them with feelings much more complacent than those of
Dr. Clarke and his friends, when their hopes of passing
"one night free from the attacks of vermin" were
changed into despair by the information of the laughing
Sheik, that "the king of the fleas held his court at Tiberias:"
or than those of MM. Lewis and Clarke, who
found them more tormenting than all the other plagues
of the Missouri country, where they sometimes compel
even the natives to shift their quarters. If you unhappily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
view them in this unfavourable light, and have
found ordinary methods unavailing for ridding yourself
of these unbidden guests; I can furnish you with a <i>probatum
est</i> recipe, which the first-mentioned traveller tells
us the Hungarian shepherds (who seem to have been stupidly
insensible to their value as alarums) find completely
effectual to put to flight these insects and their
neighbours the lice. This is not, as you may be tempted
to think, by a remarkable attention to cleanliness.&mdash;Quite
the reverse.&mdash;They grease their linen with hog's
lard, and thus render themselves disgusting even to
fleas! If this does not satisfy, I have another recipe in
store for you. You may shoot at them with a cannon,
as report says did Christina queen of Sweden, whose
piece of artillery, of Lilliputian calibre, which was employed
in this warfare, is still exhibited in the arsenal of
Stockholm<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. But, seriously, if you wish for an effectual
remedy, that prescribed by old Tusser, in the following
lines, will answer your purpose:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While wormwood hath seed, get a handfull or twaine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To save against March, to make flea to refraine:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where chamber is sweeped, and wormwood is strown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No flea for his life dare abide to be known."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this genus belongs an insect, abundant in the
West Indies and South America, the attacks of which
are infinitely more serious than those of the common
flea. You will readily conjecture that I am speaking of
the celebrated <i>Chigoe</i> or <i>Jiggers</i>, called also <i>Nigua</i>,
<i>Tungua</i>, and <i>Pique</i><a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, (<i>Pulex penetrans</i>,) one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
direst personal pests with which the sins of man have
been visited. All disputes concerning the genus of this
insect would have been settled long before Swartz's
time, (who first gave a satisfactory description and figure
of it, proving it to be a <i>Pulex</i>, as has been observed
above<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>,) had success attended the patriotic attempt of
the Capuchin friar recorded by Walton in his <i>History
of St. Domingo</i>, who brought away with him from that
island a colony of these animals, which he permitted to
establish themselves in one of his feet; but unfortunately
for himself, and for science, the foot intrusted with the
precious deposit mortified, was obliged to be amputated,
and with all its inhabitants committed to the waves.
According to Ulloa, and his opinion is confirmed by
Jussieu, there are two South American species of this
mischievous insect. It is described as generally attacking
the feet and legs<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, getting, without being felt, between
the skin and the flesh, usually under the nails of
the toes, where it nidificates and lays its eggs; and if
timely attention be not paid to it, which, as it occasions
no other uneasiness than itching, (the sensation at first,
I am assured, is rather pleasing than otherwise,) is sometimes
neglected, it multiplies to such a degree, as to be
attended by the most fatal consequences, often, as in the
above instance, rendering amputation necessary, and
sometimes causing death<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>. The female slaves in the
West Indies are frequently employed to extract these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
pests, which they do with uncommon dexterity. Yarico,
so celebrated in prose and verse, performed this kind
office for honest Ligon, who says, in his <i>History of
Barbadoes</i>, "I have had ten (Chegoes) taken out of my
feet in a morning, by the most unfortunate Yarico, an
Indian woman<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>." Humboldt observes, "that the whites
born in the torrid zone walk barefoot with impunity in
the same apartment where a European recently landed
is exposed to the attack of this animal. The <i>Nigua</i>
therefore distinguishes what the most delicate chemical
analysis could not distinguish, the cellular membrane
and blood of a European from those of a creole white<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>."</p>

<p>You have already, perhaps, been satiated with the
account before given of our enemies of the <i>Acarus</i> tribe:
there are a few, however, which I could not with propriety
introduce there, as they do not take up their abode
and breed in us, which nevertheless annoy us considerably.
One of these is a hexapod so minute, that, were
it not for the uncommon brilliancy of its colour, which
is the most vivid crimson that can be conceived, it would
be quite invisible. It is known by the name of the harvest-bug,
(<i>Leptus autumnalis</i>,) and is so called, I imagine,
from its attacking the legs of the labourers employed in
the harvest, in the flesh of which it buries itself at the
root of the hairs, producing intolerable itching, attended
by inflammation and considerable tumours, and sometimes
even occasioning fevers<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.&mdash;A similar insect is found
in Brazil, abounding in the rainy season, particularly
during the gleams of sunshine, or fine days that intervene;
as small as a point, and moving very fast. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
animals get upon the linen and cover it in a moment;
afterwards they insinuate themselves into the skin and
occasion a most intolerable itching. They are with difficulty
extracted, and leave behind them large livid tumours,
which subside in a day or two. An insect very
tormenting to the wood-cutters and the settlers on the
Mosquito shore and the bay of Honduras, and called
by them <i>the doctor</i>, is thought to be synonymous with
this<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.&mdash;More serious consequences have been known to
follow the bite of another mite related to the above, if
not the same species, common in Martinique, and called
there the <i>B√™te rouge</i>. When our soldiers in camp were
attacked by this animal, dangerous ulcers succeeded
the symptoms just mentioned, which, in several cases,
became so bad, that the limb affected was obliged to be
taken off<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>I was once collecting insects in Norwood, near London,
when my hands were covered by a number of small
hungry ticks, which were so greedy after blood, that
they penetrated deep into my flesh, giving me no little
pain; and it was not without difficulty that I extracted
them. I suspect that this was the dog-tick (<i>Ixodes
Ricinus</i>) which is often found on plants; but I am not
certain, as I neglected to examine it, my attention at that
time being almost wholly given to <i>Coleoptera</i>. Lyonnet
seems to have been attacked, in one of his entomological
excursions, by the same or a similar insect, which he
broke, so firmly had it fixed itself, in endeavouring to
extract it; and he was obliged to lay open the place lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
an abscess should be formed<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. But the worst of all the
tick tribe is the American (<i>Ixodes americanus</i>) described
by Professor Kalm. This insect, which is related to
the preceding, is found in the woods of North America,
and is equally an enemy to man and beast. They are
there so infinitely numerous, that if you sit down upon
the ground, or upon the trunk of a tree, or walk with
naked feet or legs, they will cover you, and, plunging
their serrated rostrum into the bare places of the body,
begin to suck your blood, going deeper and deeper till
they are half buried in the flesh. Though at first they
occasion no uneasiness, when they have thus made good
their settlement, they produce an intolerable itching, followed
by acute pain and large tumours. It is now extremely
difficult to extract them, the animal rather suffering
itself to be pulled to pieces than let go its hold;
so that the rostrum and head being often left in the
wound, produce an inflammation and suppuration which
render it deep and dangerous. These ticks are at first
very small, sometimes scarcely visible, but by suction
will swell themselves out till they are as big as the end
of one's finger, when they often fall to the ground of
themselves<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. The serrated haustellum of the ticks, which,
like the barbed sting of a bee, cannot be extracted unless
the animal cooperates, is well worth your inspection;
and the species which infests our dogs is so common
that you will have no difficulty in procuring one for examination.</p>

<p>I have now introduced you to the principal insects of
the <i>Aptera</i> order of Linn√©, which, in spite of all his care
and all his power, assail the lord of the creation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
make him their food. You will here, however, perhaps
accuse me of omitting one very prominent annoyer of
our comfort and repose, which you think belongs to
this tribe&mdash;the bed-bug (<i>Cimex lectularius</i>). When you
are a more practised entomologist, you will see clearly
that this, though it has no wings, appertains to another
order: nevertheless it may be introduced here without
impropriety. Though now too common and well known,
in this country it was formerly a rare insect. Had it
not, two noble ladies, mentioned by Mouffet, would
scarcely have been thrown into such an alarm by the
appearance of bug-bites upon them; which, until their
fears were dispelled by their physician, who happened
also to be a naturalist, they considered as nothing less
than symptoms of the plague. Being shown the living
cause of their fright, their fears gave place to mirth and
laughter<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>. Commerce, with many good things, has also
introduced amongst us many great evils, of which noxious
insects form no small part; and one of her worst presents
were doubtless the disgusting animals now before us.
They seem, indeed, as the above fact proves, to have
been productive of greater alarm at first than mischief,
at least if we may judge from the change of name which
took place upon their becoming common. Their original
English name was <i>Chinche</i> or <i>Wall-louse</i><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>; and
the term <i>Bug</i>, which is a Celtic word, signifying a ghost
or goblin, was applied to them after Ray's time, most
probably because they were considered as "terrors by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
night<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>." But however horrible bugs may have been in
the estimation of some, or nauseating in that of others,
many of the good people of London seem to regard
them with the greatest apathy, and take very little pains
to get rid of them; not generally, however, it is to be
hoped, to such an extent as the predecessor of a correspondent
in Nicholson's <i>Journal</i>, who found his house
so dreadfully infested by them, that it resembled the
Banian hospital at Surat<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, all his endeavours to destroy
them being at first in vain. And no wonder; for, as he
learned from a neighbour, his predecessor would never
suffer them to be disturbed or his bedsteads to be removed,
till, in the end, they swarmed to an incredible
degree, crawling up even the walls of his drawing-room;
and after his death millions were found in his bed and
chamber furniture<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.</p>

<p>The winged insects of the order to which the bed-bug
belongs, often inflict very painful wounds.&mdash;I was once
attacked by a small species, near <i>Cimex Nemorum</i>, L.
(<i>Hylophila</i>, K.), which put me nearly to as much torture
as the sting of a wasp. The water boatman (<i>Notonecta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
glauca</i>), an insect related to the <i>Cimicid√¶</i>, which always
swims upon its back, made me suffer still more severely,
as if I had been burned, by the insertion of its rostrum;
but the wound was not followed by any inflammation;
and long before me Willughby had made the same discovery
and observation<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. St. Pierre, in his <i>Voyage to
Mauritius</i>, mentions a species of bug found in that island,
the bite of which is more venomous than the sting of a
scorpion, and is succeeded by a tumour as big as the
egg of a pigeon, which continues for four or five days.
You are well acquainted with the history and properties
of the <i>Raia Torpedo</i> and <i>Gymnotus electricus</i>; but, I
dare aver, have no idea that any <i>insect</i> possesses their
extraordinary powers.&mdash;Yet I can assure you, upon good
authority, that <i>Reduvius serratus</i>, commonly known in
the West Indies by the name of the wheel-bug, can, like
them, communicate an electric shock to the person whose
flesh it touches. The late Major-general Davies, of
the Royal Artillery, well known as a most accurate observer
of nature and an indefatigable collector of her
treasures, as well as a most admirable painter of them,
once informed me, that when abroad, having taken up
this animal and placed it upon his hand, it gave him a
considerable shock, as if from an electric jar, with its
legs, which he felt as high as his shoulders; and, dropping
the creature, he observed six marks upon his hand
where the six feet had stood.</p>

<p>You may now possibly think that I have nearly gone
through the catalogue of our <i>personal</i> assailants of the
insect tribes. If such, however, is your expectation, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fear you will be disappointed, since I have many more,
and some tremendous ones, to enumerate: but as a small
compensation for such a detail of evils and injuries to
which our species is exposed from foes seemingly so insignificant,
and of acts of rebellion of the vilest and most
despised of our subjects against our boasted supremacy,
the objects to which I shall next call your attention are
not, like most of our apterous enemies, calculated to excite
disgust and nausea when we see them or speak of
them; nor do they usually steal upon us during the silent
hours of repose, (though I must except here the gnat
or mosquito,) but are many of them very beautiful, and
boldly make their attack upon us in open day, when we
are best able to defend ourselves. Borne on rapid wings,
wherever they find us, they endeavour to lay us under
contribution, and the tribute they exact is our blood.
Wonderful and various are the weapons that enable
them to enforce their demand. What would you think
of any large animal that should come to attack you with
a tremendous apparatus of knives and lancets issuing
from its mouth? Yet such are the instruments by means
of which the fire-eyed and blood-thirsty horse-fly (<i>Tabanus</i>,
L.) makes an incision in your flesh; and then,
forming a siphon of them, often carries off many drops
of your blood<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>. The pain they inflict, when they open
a vein, is usually very acute. A fly of this kind not
only occasioned Mr. Sheppard considerable pain by its
bite, but also produced swelling and blackness round
one eye; and the flesh of his cheek and chin was so enlarged
from it as to hang down. And Mr. W. S. MacLeay
thus describes to me the annoyance he suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
from one of them. "I went down the other day to the
country, and was fairly driven out of it by the <i>H√¶matopota
pluvialis</i>, which attacked me with such fury, that
although I did not at last venture beyond the door without
a veil, my face and hands were swelled to that degree
as to be scarcely yet recovered from the effects of
their venom. I was obliged on my return to town to
stay two days at home. Whenever this insect bites me
it has this effect, and I have never been able to discover
any remedy for the torture it puts me to." In this country,
however, the attacks of these flies are usually not
frequent enough to make them more than a minor "misery
of human life;" but the burning-fly (<i>brulot</i>) or sand-fly
of America<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and the West Indies, which seem to be
the same insect, causes a much more intolerable anguish,
which has been compared to what a red-hot needle or a
spark of fire would occasion us to endure. Lambert, in
his <i>Travels through Canada</i>, &amp;c. says, "They are so very
small as to be hardly perceptible in their attacks; and
your forehead will be streaming with blood before you
are sensible of being amongst them<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>."&mdash;Yet we have one
species (<i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>) alluded to in a former letter
as so nearly resembling the common house-fly<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>, which,
though its oral instruments are to appearance not near
so tremendous, is a much greater torment than the horse-fly.
This little pest, I speak feelingly, incessantly interrupts
our studies and comfort in showery weather,
making us even stamp like the cattle by its attacks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
our legs; and, if we drive it away ever so often, returning
again and again to the charge. In Canada they are infinitely
worse. "I have sat down to write," says Lambert,
(who though he calls it the house-fly is evidently speaking
of the Stomoxys,) "and have been obliged to throw
away my pen in consequence of their irritating bite, which
has obliged me every moment to raise my hand to my
eyes, nose, mouth, and ears in constant succession.
When I could no longer write, I began to read, and
was always obliged to keep one hand constantly on the
move towards my head. Sometimes in the course of a
few minutes I would take half a dozen of my tormentors
from my lips, between which I caught them just as they
perched<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>."</p>

<p>The swallow-fly (<i>Craterina Hirundinis</i><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>), whose natural
food is the bird after which it is named, has been
known to make its repast on the human species. One
found its way into a bed of the Rev. R. Sheppard, where
it first, for several nights, sorely annoyed a friend of his,
and afterwards himself, without their suspecting the culprit.
After a close search, however, it was discovered
in the form of this fly, which, forsaking the nest of the
swallow, had by some chance taken its station between
the sheets, and thus glutted itself with the blood of man.&mdash;In
travelling between Edam and Purmerend in North
Holland (July 21, 1815), in an open vehicle, I was much
teased by another bird-fly (<i>Ornithomyia avicularia</i>) (two
individuals of which I caught) alighting upon my head,
and inserting its rostrum into my flesh.&mdash;Mr. Sheppard
remarks, as a reason for this dereliction of their appropriate
food, that no sooner does life depart from the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
that these flies infest, than they immediately desert it and
take flight, alighting upon the first living creature that
they meet with; which if it be not a bird they soon quit,
but, as it should seem from the above facts, not before
they have made a trial how it will suit them as food.</p>

<p>But of all the insect-tormentors of man, none are so
loudly and universally complained of as the species of
the genus <i>Culex</i>, L., whether known by the name of
gnats or mosquitos<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>. Pliny, after Aristotle, distinguishes
well between <i>Hymenoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>, when he says
the former have their sting in their tail, and the latter
in their mouth; and that to the one this weapon is given
as the instrument of vengeance, and to the other of avidity<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.
But the instrument of avidity in the genus of
which I am speaking, is even more terrible than that of
vengeance in most insects that are armed with it: like
the latter also, as appears from the consequent inflammation
and tumour, it instills into its wound a poison;
the principal use of which, however, is to render the
blood more fluid and fitter for suction. This weapon,
which is more complex than the sting of hymenopterous
insects, consisting of five pieces besides the exterior
sheath, some of which seem simply lancets, while others
are barbed like the spicula of a bee's sting, is at once
calculated for piercing the flesh and forming a siphon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
adapted to imbibe the blood<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. There are several species
of this genus whose bite is severe, but none is to be compared
to the common gnat (<i>Culex pipiens</i>, L.), if, as has
been generally affirmed, it be synonymous with the mosquito
(though perhaps several species are confounded
under both names); and to this, the most insatiable of
blood-suckers, I shall principally direct your attention<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p>In this country they are justly regarded as no trifling
evil; for they follow us to all our haunts, intrude into
our most secret retirements, assail us in the city and in
the country, in our houses and in our fields, in the sun
and in the shade: nay, they pursue us to our pillows,
and either keep us awake by the ceaseless hum of their
droning pipe, and their incessant endeavours to fix themselves
upon our face, or some uncovered part of our
body; or, if in spite of them we fall asleep, awaken us by
the acute pain which attends the insertion of their oral
stings; attacking with most avidity the softer sex, and
trying their temper by disfiguring their beauty. But
although with us they are usually rather teasing than injurious;
yet upon some occasions they have approached
nearer to the character of a plague, and emulated with
success the mosquitos of other climates. Thus, we are
told that in the year 1736 they were so numerous, that
vast columns of them were seen to rise in the air from
Salisbury cathedral, which at a distance resembled
columns of smoke, and occasioned many people to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
that the cathedral was on fire. A similar occurrence,
in like manner giving rise to an alarm of the church
being on fire, took place in July 1812 at Sagan in Silesia<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.
In the following year at Norwich, in May, at
about six o'clock in the evening, the inhabitants of that
city were alarmed by the appearance of smoke issuing
from the upper window of the spire of the cathedral, for
which at the time no satisfactory account could be given,
but which was most probably produced by the same
cause. And in the year 1766, in the month of August,
they appeared in such incredible numbers at Oxford as
to resemble a black cloud, darkening the air and almost
totally intercepting the beams of the sun. One day, a
little before sun-set, six columns of them were observed
to ascend from the boughs of an apple-tree, some in a
perpendicular and others in an oblique direction, to the
height of fifty or sixty feet. Their bite was so envenomed,
that it was attended by violent and alarming inflammation;
and one when killed usually contained as
much blood as would cover three or four square inches
of wall<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. Our great poet Spenser seems to have witnessed
a similar appearance of them, which furnished
him with the following beautiful simile:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As when a swarme of gnats at eventide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the fennes of Allan doe arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their murmuring small trumpets sownden wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whiles in the air their clust'ring army flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That as a cloud doth seem to dim the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne man nor beast may rest or take repast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their sharp wounds and noyous injuries.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Till the fierce northern wind with blust'ring blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth blow them quite away, and in the ocean cast.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Marshland in Norfolk, as I learn from a lady who
had an opportunity of personal inspection, the inhabitants
are so annoyed by the gnats, that the better sort of
them, as in many hot climates, have recourse to a gauze
covering for their beds, to keep them off during the night.
Whether this practice obtains in other fen districts I do
not know.</p>

<p>But these evils are of small account compared with
what other countries, especially when we approach the
poles or the line, are destined to suffer from them; for
there they interfere so much with ease and comfort, as
to become one of the worst of pests and a real misery of
human life. We may be disposed to smile perhaps at
the story Mr. Weld relates from General Washington,
that in one place the mosquitos were so powerful as to
pierce through his boots<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> (probably they crept within
the boots): but in various regions scarcely any thing
less impenetrable than leather can withstand their insinuating
weapons and unwearied attacks. One would
at first imagine that regions where the polar winter extends
its icy reign would not be much annoyed by insects:
but however probable the supposition, it is the
reverse of fact, for nowhere are gnats more numerous.
These animals, as well as numbers of the <i>Tipulari√¶</i> of
Latreille, seem endowed with the privilege of resisting
any degree of cold, and of bearing any degree of heat.
In Lapland their numbers are so prodigious as to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
compared to a flight of snow when the flakes fall thickest,
or to the dust of the earth. The natives cannot take a
mouthful of food, or lie down to sleep in their cabins,
unless they be fumigated almost to suffocation. In the air
you cannot draw your breath without having your mouth
and nostrils filled with them; and unguents of tar, fish-grease,
or cream; or nets steeped in fetid birch-oil, are
scarcely sufficient to protect even the case-hardened
cuticle of the Laplander from their bite<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>. In certain
districts of France, the accurate Reaumur informs us
that he has seen people whose arms and legs have become
quite monstrous from wounds inflicted by gnats; and in
some cases in such a state as to render it doubtful whether
amputation would not be necessary<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>. In the neighbourhood
of the Crimea the Russian soldiers are obliged
to sleep in sacks to defend themselves from the mosquitos;
and even this is not a sufficient security, for several
of them die in consequence of mortification produced
by the bites of these furious blood-suckers. This
fact is related by Dr. Clarke, and to its probability his
own painful experience enabled him to speak. He informs
us that the bodies of himself and his companions,
in spite of gloves, clothes, and handkerchiefs, were rendered
one entire wound, and the consequent excessive
irritation and swelling excited a considerable degree of
fever. In a most sultry night, when not a breath of air
was stirring, exhausted by fatigue, pain, and heat, he
sought shelter in his carriage: and, though almost suffocated,
could not venture to open a window for fear of
the mosquitos. Swarms nevertheless found their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
into his hiding-place; and, in spite of the handkerchiefs
with which he had bound up his head, filled his mouth,
nostrils, and ears. In the midst of his torment he succeeded
in lighting a lamp, which was extinguished in a
moment by such a prodigious number of these insects,
that their carcases actually filled the glass chimney, and
formed a large conical heap over the burner. The noise
they make in flying cannot be conceived by persons who
have only heard gnats in England. It is to all that hear
it a most fearful sound<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>. Travellers and mariners who
have visited warmer climates give a similar account of
the torments there inflicted by these little demons. One
traveller in Africa complains that after a fifty miles
journey they would not suffer him to rest, and that his
face and hands appeared, from their bites, as if he was
infected with the small-pox in its worst stage<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. In the
East, at Batavia, Dr. Arnold, a most attentive and accurate
observer, relates that their bite is the most venomous
he ever felt, occasioning a most intolerable itching, which
lasts several days. The sight or sound of a single one
either prevented him from going to bed for a whole night,
or obliged him to rise many times. This species, which
I have examined, is distinct from the common gnat, and
appears to be nondescript. It approaches nearest to
<i>C. annulatus</i>, but the wings are black and not spotted.
And Captain Stedman in America, as a proof of the
dreadful state to which he and his soldiers were reduced
by them, mentions that they were forced to sleep with
their heads thrust into holes made in the earth with
their bayonets, and their necks wrapped round with their
hammocks<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>From Humboldt also we learn that "between the
little harbour of Higuerote and the mouth of the Rio
Unare the wretched inhabitants are accustomed to stretch
themselves on the ground, and pass the night buried in
the sand three or four inches deep, leaving out the head
only, which they cover with a handkerchief." This illustrious
traveller has given an account in detail of these
insect plagues, by which it appears that amongst them
there are diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal species, or
genera: the <i>Mosquitos</i> or <i>Simulia</i> flying in the day; the
<i>Temporaneros</i>, probably a kind of <i>Culex</i>, flying during
twilight; and the <i>Zancudos</i> or <i>Culices</i> in the night. So
that there is no rest for the inhabitants from their torment
day or night, except for a short interval between
the retreat of one species and the attack of another. We
learn from this author that the sting or bite of the <i>Simulium</i>
is as bad as that of the <i>Stomoxys</i> before noticed<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not therefore incredible that Sapor, king of
Persia, as is related, should have been compelled to raise
the siege of Nisibis by a plague of gnats, which attacking
his elephants and beasts of burthen, so caused the
rout of his army, whatever we may think of the miracle
to which it was attributed<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>; nor that the inhabitants of
various cities, as Mouffet has collected from different
authors<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, should, by an extraordinary multiplication of
this plague, have been compelled to desert them; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that by their power to do mischief, like other conquerors
who have been the torment of the human race, they should
have attained to fame, and have given their name to bays,
towns, and even to considerable territories<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>And now, which seems to you the greater terror, that
the forest should resound with the roar of the lion or
the tiger, or with the hum of the gnat? Which evil is
most to be deprecated, the neighbourhood of these ferocious
animals, terrible as they are for their cruelty and
strength, or to live amidst the polar or tropical myriads
of mosquitos, and be subject to the torture of their incessant
attacks? When you consider that from the one,
prudence and courage may secure or defend us without
any material sacrifice of our daily comforts; while to be
at rest from the other, we must either render ourselves
disgusting by filthy unguents, or be suffocated by fumigations,
or be content to be bound, head, hand and foot,
shut out from the respiration of the common air, and
even thus scarcely escape from their annoyance; you will
feel convinced that the former is the more tolerable evil
of the two, and be inclined to think that those cities, from
which the lions were driven away by the more powerful
gnats, were no great gainers by the exchange<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>. With
what grateful hearts ought the privileged inhabitants of
these happy islands to acknowledge and glorify the goodness
of that kind Providence which has distinguished us
from the less favoured nations of the globe, by what may
be deemed an immunity from this tormenting pest! for
the inroads which they make on our comfort, when contrasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
with what so many other people of every climate
suffer from them, are mere nothings. When we behold
on one side of us the ravages of the wide-wasting sword,
on another those of infectious disease or pestilence, on a
third famine destroying its myriads, and on a fourth life
rendered uncomfortable by the terror of "noisome beasts,"
and the attack of noxious insects: and when we look at
home and see every one eating his bread in peace, protected
in his enjoyments by equal laws executed by a
mild government under a paternal king, without fearing
the sword of the oppressor; not scourged by pestilence
or famine, exposed to the attack of no ferocious animal,
and comparatively speaking but slightly visited by the
annoyance of insect tormentors; and especially when we
further reflect that it is his mercy and not our merits
which has induced him thus to overwhelm us with blessings,
while other countries have been made to drink
deep of the cup of his fury, we shall see reason for an
increased degree of thankfulness and gratitude, and, instead
of repining, be well content with our lot, though
our offences have not wholly been passed over, and we
have been "beaten with few stripes."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Besides the insects that seek to make us their food,
there are others, which, although we are apt to regard
them with the greatest horror, do not attack us with this
view, but usually to revenge some injury which they
have received, or apprehend from us. Foremost in the
list of these are those with four wings, which, according
to the observation of Pliny before quoted, carry their
weapon, an instrument of revenge, in their <i>tail</i>. These
all belong to the Linnean order <i>Hymenoptera</i>; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
tremendous arms with which they annoy us, are two
darts finer than a hair, furnished on their outer side at
the end with several barbs not visible to the naked eye,
and each moving in the groove of a strong and often
curved sheath, frequently mistaken for the sting, which,
when the darts enter the flesh, usually injects a drop of
subtle venom, furnished from a peculiar vessel in which
it is secreted, into the wound, occasioning, especially if
the darts be not extracted, a considerable tumour, accompanied
by very acute pain. Many insects are thus
armed and have this power. Twice I have been stung
by an Ichneumon; first by one with a concealed sting,
and afterwards by another of the family of <i>Pimpla Manifestator</i>,
with a very long exerted one. I had held the
insect by its sting, which it withdrew from between my
fingers with surprising force, and then, as if in revenge,
stung me. <i>Pompilus viaticus</i>, one of the spider-wasps,
once, in this way, gave me acute pain. Mr. W. S. MacLeay
states that at the Havana he was once stung by a
gigantic <i>Pompilus</i> (probably <i>P. Heros</i>), from which he
suffered a very short-lived pain, but the wound bled as
if punctured by a pin. The bleeding he conjectures
carried off the venom. But the insects which in this respect
principally attract our notice by exciting our fears,
are the hive-bee, the wasp, and the hornet. The first of
these, the <i>bee</i>, sometimes manifests an antipathy to particular
individuals, whom it attacks and wounds without
provocation; but the two last, though apparently the
most formidable, are not so ill-tempered as they are conceived
to be, seldom molesting those who do not first
interfere with or disturb them. We learn from Scripture
that the <i>hornet</i> (but whether it was the common
species is uncertain) was employed by Providence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
drive out the impious inhabitants of Canaan, or subdue
them under the hand of the Israelites<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.&mdash;The effect produced
by the sting of these animals is different in different
persons. To some they occasion only a very slight
inconvenience or a momentary pain; others feel the
smart of the wounds which they inflict for several days,
and are thrown into fevers by them; and to some they
have even proved fatal<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>. Yet these insects are certainly,
in general, but a trifling evil. They become, however,
especially <i>wasps</i>, a very serious one to many, from the
mere dread of being stung by them, even though they
should not carry their fears to the same length with the
lady mentioned by Dr. Fairfax<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>, in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i>, who had such a horror of them, that during
the season in which they abound in houses, she always
confined herself to her apartment.</p>

<p><i>Ants</i> are insects of this order, which, though our indigenous
species may be regarded as harmless, in some
countries are gifted with double means of annoyance,
both from their sting and their bite. A green kind in
New South Wales was observed by Sir Joseph Banks
to inflict a wound scarcely less painful than the sting of
a bee<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. Another, from the intolerable anguish occasioned
by its bite, which resembles that produced by a
spark of fire, and seems attended by venom, is called
the fire-ant. Captain Stedman relates that this caused
a whole company of soldiers to start and jump about as
if scalded with boiling water; and its nests were so numerous
that it was not easy to avoid them<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. We are
told of a third species, which emulates the scorpion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the malignity of its sting or bite<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>. Knox, in his account
of Ceylon, mentions a black ant, called by the natives
<i>Coddia</i>, which he says "bites desperately, as bad as if
a man were burnt by a coal of fire; but they are of
a noble nature, and will not begin unless you disturb
them." The reason the Cinghalese assign for the horrible
pain occasioned by their bite is curious, and will
serve to amuse you. "Formerly these ants went to
ask a wife of the <i>Noya</i>, a venomous and noble kind of
snake; and because they had such a high spirit to dare
to offer to be related to such a generous creature, they
had this virtue bestowed upon them, that they should
sting after this manner. And if they had obtained a wife
of the Noya, they should have had the privilege to sting
full as bad as he<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>." Stedman's story of a large ant that
stripped the trees of their leaves, to feed, as was supposed,
a blind serpent under ground<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>, is somewhat akin
to this: as is also another, related to me by a friend of
mine, of a species of Mantis, now in my cabinet, taken
in one of the Indian islands, which, according to the
received opinion amongst the natives, was the parent of
all their serpents. Whence, unless perhaps from their
noxious qualities, could this idea of a connexion between
insects and these reptiles be derived? But to return
from this digression&mdash;&mdash;Madame Merian's Ant of Visitation
(<i>&#338;codoma cephalotes</i>) will be considered in a subsequent
letter: but I cannot here omit a circumstance
mentioned by Don Felix de Azara, a late Spanish traveller,
who confirms her account,&mdash;that these animals
are so alarming and tremendous in their attacks, that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
they enter a house in the night, the inhabitants are obliged
to rise with all speed and run off in their shirts.</p>

<p>I must next direct your attention to an insect, which
perhaps more than any other has in every age been an
object of terror and abhorrence&mdash;I mean the redoubted
<i>scorpion</i>. And though I shall not, with Aristotle, tell
you of Persian kings employing armies for several days
in destroying them; or, with Pliny, of countries that
they have depopulated; yet my account will not be devoid
of that species of interest which the dread of its
power to do us injury imparts to any object. Could you
see one of these ferocious animals, perhaps a foot in
length, a size to which they sometimes attain, advancing
towards you in their usual menacing attitude, with its
claws expanded, and its many-jointed tail turned over its
head; were your heart ever so stout, I think you would
start back and feel a horror come across you; and,
though you knew not the animal, you would conclude
that such an aspect of malignity must be the precursor
of malignant effects. Nor would you be mistaken, as
you will presently see. This alarming animal, though
like hymenopterous insects it is armed with a sting, is in
no respect related to that order, and forms the only genus,
at present known, of the others that is so armed.
Even its sting is totally different from that of bees,
wasps, and other Hymenoptera, being more analogous
to the venomous tooth of serpents; it wounds us with
no barbed darts concealed in a sheath, but only with a
simple incurved mucro terminating an ampullaceous
joint. Two orifices, or according to some three, are
said to instill the poison, which, we are informed, is
sometimes as white as milk. This venom in our European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
species is seldom attended, except to minor animals,
by any very serious consequences; yet when it is
communicated by the scorpion of warmer climates it
produces more baneful effects. The sting of certain
kinds common in South America causes fevers, numbness
in various parts of the body, tumours in the tongue,
and dimness of sight, which symptoms last from twenty-four
to forty-eight hours. The only means of saving
the lives of our soldiers who were stung by them in
Egypt, was amputation. One species is said to occasion
madness; and the black scorpion, both of South America
and Ceylon, frequently inflicts a mortal wound<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.
No known animal is more cruel and ferocious in its manners;
they kill and devour their own young without pity
as soon as they are born, and they are equally savage to
their fellows when grown up. Terrible however and revolting
as these creatures appear, we are gravely told
by Naud√©, that there is a species of scorpion in Italy
which is domesticated, and put between the sheets to
cool the beds during the heats of summer<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>!!</p>

<p>I must next say something of insects that annoy us
solely by their <i>jaws</i>. Of this description is <i>Galeodes
araneoides</i> which is related to the scorpion, although
devoid of a sting. The bite of this animal, which is a
native of the Cape of Good Hope and of Russia<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>, is represented
to be often fatal both to man and beast. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
species of <i>Galeodes</i> is described by Professor Lichtenstein,
which, from the trivial name that he has given
it (<i>fatalis</i>), may be supposed to be as venomous as the
former<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p>

<p>The bite of one of the centipedes (<i>Scolopendra morsitans</i>)&mdash;the
under-jaws, or rather arms, of which are armed
with a strong claw, furnished like the sting of the scorpion
with an orifice, visible under a common lens<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>, from
which poison issues&mdash;is less tremendous than that of the
animal last mentioned: but though not mortal, its wounds
are more painful than those produced by the sting of the
scorpion; and as these animals creep every where, even
into beds, they must be very annoying in warm climates
where they abound. Dr. Martin Lister, in his <i>Travels</i>,
has given us a figure of an insect related to this genus,
that he saw in Plumier's collection, which appears to have
been eighteen inches in length, and three quarters of an
inch in width, having ninety-five legs on each side, the
first eight of which are armed with double claws, and
two inches of the tail being without legs. It may form
a distinct genus, and is probably a native of South America.
Yet even this monstrous insect is nothing to those
at Carthagena, mentioned by Ulloa, (if indeed we may
credit his account, or if his translator has not mistaken
his meaning,) which sometimes exceeded a yard in length
and five inches in breadth! The bite of this gigantic
serpent-like creature, he tells us, is mortal, as well it
may, if a timely remedy be not applied. From its cylindrical
form it should be a Julus<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.</p>

<p>In this catalogue of noxious insects I must not omit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
those which every where force themselves upon our notice,
and are viewed with general disgust. I mean the
numerous family of Arachne, the insidious spiders. Few
of these, however, are really personal assailants of man.
The principal is that which has given rise to so much
discussion, and has so much employed the pens of naturalists
and physicians&mdash;the famous <i>Tarentula</i> (<i>Lycosa
Tarentula</i>). The effects ascribed to its wounds, and
their wonderful cure supposed to be wrought by music
and dancing, have long been celebrated: but after all
there seems to have been more of fraud than of truth in
the business; and the whole evil appears to consist in
swelling and inflammation. Dr. Clavitio submitted to be
bitten by this animal, and no bad effects ensued; and
the Count de Borch, a Polish nobleman, bribed a man
to undergo the same experiment, in whom the only result
was a swelling in the hand, attended by intolerable itching.
The fellow's sole remedy was a bottle of wine,
which charmed away all his pain without the aid of pipe
and tabor<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<p>There is however a spider (<i>Theridium</i> 13<i>-guttatum</i>)
the bite of which is said to be very dangerous, and even
mortal. Thi√©baut de Berneaud, in his <i>Voyage to Elba</i><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>,
affirms that in the Volterrano he knew that several country
people and domestic animals died in consequence
of it. And according to Mr. Jackson, a spider, called
there the <i>Tendaraman</i>, is found in Marocco which has
venomous powers equally formidable. The bite of this
insect, which is about the size and colour of a hornet
but rounder, and spins a web so fine as to be almost invisible,
is said to be so poisonous that the person bitten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
survives but a few hours. In the cork forests the sportsman,
eager in his pursuit of game, frequently carries
away on his garments this fatal insect, which is asserted
always to make towards the head before inflicting its
deadly wound<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I suspect you will think this list long enough; and I
believe it includes the most remarkable insects that assail
the surface of our bodies, to answer either the demands
of hunger or the stimulus of revenge. There is however
a third class of insect annoyers, as I observed at
the beginning of this letter, which, though they neither
make us their food, nor attack us under the impulse of
fear or revenge, incommode us extremely in other ways.
These must now be detailed to you.</p>

<p>How extremely unpleasant is the sensation which that
very minute fly, <i>Thrips physapus</i>, excites in sultry weather,
merely by creeping over our skin! I have sometimes
found this almost intolerable. A similar torment
reckoned by Ulloa a kind of Mosquito, infests the inhabitants
of Carthagena in South America. They are there
called <i>Mantas blancas</i>, and creeping between the threads
of the gauze curtains that keep off the former pest,
though they do not bite, occasion an itching that is
dreadfully tormenting<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>. But these are nothing compared
with the teasing attacks of another gnat (<i>Simulium reptans</i>),
which, as Linn√© informs us, who misnamed it a
Culex, is so incredibly numerous in Lapland, as entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
to cover a man's body, turning a white dress into a black
one, occupying the whole atmosphere, filling the mouth,
nostrils, eyes, and ears of travellers, and thus preventing
respiration, and almost choking them. These little animals,
he says, do not bite, but torture incessantly by
their titillation<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.&mdash;In New South Wales a small ant was
observed by Sir Joseph Banks, inhabiting the roots of a
plant, which when disturbed rushed out by myriads, and
running over the uncovered parts of the body produced
a sensation of this kind that was worse than pain.</p>

<p>The common house-fly is with us often sufficiently
annoying at the close of summer; but we know nothing
of it as a tormentor compared with the inhabitants of
southern Europe.&mdash;"I met (says Arthur Young in his
interesting <i>Travels through France</i>) between Pradelles
and Thuytz, mulberries and flies at the same time; by
the term <i>flies</i> I mean those myriads of them which form
the most disagreeable circumstance of the southern climates.
They are the first torments in Spain, Italy, and
the Olive district of France: it is not that they bite, sting,
or hurt, but they buzz, tease, and worry: your mouth,
eyes, ears, and nose, are full of them: they swarm on
every eatable,&mdash;fruit, sugar, milk, every thing is attacked
by them in such myriads, that if they are not incessantly
driven away by a person who has nothing else to do, to
eat a meal is impossible. They are however caught on
prepared paper and other contrivances with so much
ease and in such quantities, that were it not from negligence,
they could not abound in such incredible quantities.
If I farmed in these countries, I think I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
manure four or five acres every year with dead flies.&mdash;I
have been much surprised that the late learned Mr.
Harmer should think it odd to find, by writers who
treated of southern climates, that driving away flies was
an object of importance. Had he been with me in Spain
and in Languedoc in July and August, he would have
been very far from thinking there was any thing odd
in it<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>."</p>

<p>Our friend Captain Green, of the sixth regiment of
the East India Company's native troops, relates to me,
that in India, when the mangoes are ripe, which is the
hottest part of the summer, a very minute black fly
makes its appearance, which, because it flies in swarms
into the eyes, is very troublesome, and causes much
pain, is called there the <i>eye-fly</i>. At this season the eyes
are attacked by a disease, supposed to be occasioned by
eating the mangoes, but more probably the result of the
irritation produced by the fly in question, which, however,
they admit, carries the infection from one person
to another.</p>

<p>You know that the hairs taken from the pods of <i>Dolichos
pruriens</i> and <i>urens</i>, L., commonly called <i>Cowhage</i>
and <i>Cow-itch</i><a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>, occasion a most violent itching, but perhaps
are not aware that those of the <i>caterpillars</i> of several
Moths will produce the same disagreeable effect.
One of these is the procession moth, (<i>Lasiocampa processionea</i>)
of which Reaumur has given so interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
an account. In consequence of their short stiff hairs
sticking in his skin, after handling them, he suffered
extremely for several days; and being ignorant at first
of the cause of the itching, and rubbing his eyes with his
hands, he brought on a swelling of the eye-lids, so that
he could scarcely open them. Ladies were affected even
by going too near the nest of the animal, and found
their necks full of troublesome tumours, occasioned by
short hairs, or fragments of hair, brought by the wind<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.
Of this nature also is the famous Pityocampa of the ancients,
the moth of the fir (<i>Lasiocampa Pityocampa</i>), the
hairs of which are said to occasion a very intense degree
of pain, heat, fever, itching and restlessness. It was accounted
by the Romans a very deleterious poison, as
is evident from the circumstance of the Cornelian law
"<i>De sicariis</i>" being extended to persons who administered
<i>Pityocampa</i><a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.</p>

<p>In these cases the injury is the consequence of irritation
produced by the hair of the animal; but there are
facts on record, which prove that the juices of many insects
are equally deleterious. Amoreux, from a work of
Turner, an English writer on cutaneous diseases, has
given the following remarkable history of the ill effects
produced by those of <i>spiders</i>. When Turner was a
young practitioner, he was called to visit a woman,
whose custom it was, every time she went into the cellar
with a candle, to burn the spiders and their webs. She
had often observed, when she thus cruelly amused herself,
that the odour of the burning spiders had so much
affected her head, that all objects seemed to turn round,
which was occasionally succeeded by faintings, cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
sweats, and slight vomitings: but, notwithstanding this,
she found so much pleasure in tormenting these poor
animals, that nothing could cure her of this madness, till
she met with the following accident: The legs of one of
these unhappy spiders happened to stick in the candle,
so that it could not disengage itself; and, the body at
length bursting, the venom was ejaculated into the eyes
and upon the lips of its persecutrix. In consequence of
this, one of the former became inflamed, the latter swelled
excessively, even the tongue and gums were slightly affected,
and a continual vomiting attended these symptoms.
In spite of every remedy the swelling of the lips continued
to increase, till at length an old woman, by the
simple application for fifteen days of the leaves and juice
of plantain, together with some spider's web, ran away
with all the glory of the cure<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. Ulloa gives us a remarkable
account of a species of spider, or perhaps mite,
of a fiery red colour, common in Popayan, called <i>Coya</i>
or <i>Coyba</i>, and usually found in the corners of walls and
among the herbage, the venom of which is of such malignity,
that on crushing the insect, if any fall on the skin
of either man or beast, it immediately penetrates into
the flesh, and causes large tumours, which are soon succeeded
by death. Yet, he further observes, if it be
crushed between the palms of the hands, which are
usually callous, no bad consequence ensues. People who
travel along the valleys of the Neyba, where these insects
abound, are warned by their Indian attendants, if they
feel any thing stinging them, or crawling on their neck or
face, not so much as to lift up their hand to the place,
the texture of the Coya being so delicate that the least
force causes them to burst, without which there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
danger, as they seem otherwise harmless animals. The
traveller points out the spot where he feels the creature
to one of his companions, who, if it be a Coya, blows it
away. If this account does not exaggerate the deleterious
quality of the juices of this insect, it is the most venomous
animal that is known; for he describes it as much
smaller than a bug. The only remedy to which the natives
have recourse for preventing the ill effects arising
from its venom is, on the first appearance of the swelling,
to swing the patient over the flame of straw or long
grass, which they do with great dexterity: after this operation
he is reckoned to be out of danger<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.&mdash;The poisoned
arrows which Indians employ against their enemies
have been long celebrated. The Coya may, in the western
world, have furnished the poison for this purpose.
An author quoted in Lesser tells us that an ant as big as
a bee is sometimes used, and that the wound inflicted
by weapons tinctured with their venom is incurable. Patterson
also gives a recipe by which the natives of the
southern extremity of Africa prepare what they reckon
the most effectual poison for the point of their arrows.
They mix the juice of a species of Euphorbia, and a
caterpillar that feeds on a kind of sumach (<i>Rhus</i>, L.),
and when the mixture is dried it is fit for use<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>And now I think you will allow that I have made out
a tolerable list of insects that attack or annoy man's
body externally, and a sufficiently doleful history of
them. That the subject, however, may be complete, I
shall next enumerate those that, not content with afflicting
him with <i>exterior</i> pain or evil, whether on the surface
or under the skin, bore into his flesh, descend even
into his stomach and viscera; derange his whole system,
and thus often occasion his death. The punitive insects
here employed are usually larv√¶ of the various orders,
and they are the cause of that genus of diseases I before
noticed, and proposed to call <i>Scolechiasis</i>.</p>

<p>I shall begin my account with the first order of Linn√©,
because people in general seem not aware that any
<i>beetles</i> make their way into the human <i>stomach</i>. Yet
there is abundant evidence, which proves beyond controversy
that the meal-worm (<i>Tenebrio Molitor</i>), although
its usual food is flour, has often been voided both
by male and female patients; and in one instance is stated
to have occasioned death<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>. How these grubs should
get into the stomach it is difficult to say&mdash;perhaps the
eggs may have been swallowed in some preparation of
flour. But that the animal should be able to sustain the
heat of this organ, so far exceeding the temperature to
which it is usually accustomed, is the most extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
circumstance of all.&mdash;Dr. Martin Lister, who to the skill
of the physician added the most profound knowledge of
nature, mentions an instance, communicated to him by
Mr. Jessop, of a girl who voided three hexapod larv√¶
similar to what are found in the carcases of birds<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>, probably
belonging either to the genus <i>Dermestes</i>, or <i>Anthrenus</i>:
and in the <i>German Ephemerides</i> the case also
of a girl is recorded, from an abscess in the <i>calf</i> of whose
<i>leg</i> crept black worms resembling beetles<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.</p>

<p>The larv√¶ of some beetle, as appears from the description,
seem to have been ejected even from the <i>lungs</i>.
Four of these, of which the largest was nearly three
quarters of an inch long, were discovered in the mucus
expelled after a severe fit of coughing by a lady afflicted
with a pulmonary disease; and similar larv√¶ of a smaller
size were once afterwards discharged in the same way<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>No one would suppose that <i>caterpillars</i>, which feed
upon vegetable substances, could be met with alive in
the stomach; yet Dr. Lister gives an account of a boy
who vomited up several, which, he observes, had sixteen
legs<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. The eggs perhaps might have been swallowed
in salad; and, as vegetables make a part of most people's
daily diet, enough might have passed into the stomach
to support them when hatched.&mdash;Linn√© tells us that the
caterpillar of a moth (<i>Aglossa pinguinalis</i>), common in
houses, has also been found in a similar situation, and is
one of the worst of our insect infesters.&mdash;In a very old
tract, which gives a figure of the insect, a caterpillar of
the almost incredible length of the middle finger is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to have been voided from the <i>nostrils</i> of a young man
long afflicted with dreadful pains in his head<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.&mdash;But
the most extraordinary account with respect to lepidopterous
larv√¶ (unless he has mistaken his insects) is given
by Azara, the Spanish traveller before quoted; who says
that in South America there is a large brown <i>moth</i>, which
deposits its young in a kind of saliva upon the flesh of
persons who sleep naked; these introduce themselves
under the skin without being perceived, where they occasion
swelling attended by inflammation and violent pain.
When the natives discover it, they squeeze out the larv√¶,
which usually amount to five or six<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.</p>

<p>But amongst all the orders, none is more fruitful in
devourers of man than the <i>Diptera</i>. The Gad-fly (<i>&#338;strus</i>,
L.) you have, doubtless, often heard of, and how
sorely it annoys our cattle and other quadrupeds; but
I suspect have no notion that there is a species appropriated
to man. The existence, indeed, of this species
seems to have been overlooked by entomologists (though
it stands in Gmelin's edition of the <i>Systema Natur√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>,
upon the authority of the younger Linn√©,) till Humboldt
and Bonpland mentioned it again. Speaking of the low
regions of the torrid zone, where the air is filled with
those myriads of mosquitos which render uninhabitable
a great and beautiful portion of the globe, they observe
that to these may be joined the <i>&#338;strus Hominis</i>, which
deposits its eggs in the skin of man, causing there painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
tumours<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. Gmelin says that it remains beneath the
skin of the abdomen six months, penetrating deeper, if it
be disturbed, and becoming so dangerous as sometimes
to occasion death. The imago he describes as being of
a brown colour, and about the size of the common house-fly;
so that it is a small species compared with the rest
of the genus. Even the gad-fly of the ox, leaving its
proper food, has been known to oviposit in the jaw of a
woman, and the bots produced from the eggs finally
caused her death<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.&mdash;Other flies also of various kinds thus
penetrate into us, either preying upon our flesh, or getting
into our intestines. Leeuwenhoek mentions the case
of a woman whose leg had been enlarging with glandular
bodies for some years. Her surgeon gave him one that
he had cut from it, in which were many small maggots:
these he fed with flesh till they assumed the pupa, when
they produced a fly as large as the flesh-fly<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.&mdash;A patient
of Dr. Reeve of Norwich, after suffering for some time
great pain, was at last relieved by voiding a considerable
number of maggots, which agree precisely with those
described by De Geer as the larv√¶ of his <i>Musca domestica
minor</i>, (<i>Anthomyia canicularis</i>, Meig.) a fly which
he speaks of as very common in apartments<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.&mdash;In Paraguay
the flesh-flies are said to be uncommonly numerous
and noxious. Azara relates<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> that, after a storm, when
the heat was excessive, he was assailed by such an army
of them, that in less than half an hour his clothes were
quite white with their eggs, so that he was forced to
scrape them off with a knife; adding, that he has known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
instances of persons, who, after having bled at the nose
in their sleep, were attacked by the most violent headaches;
when at length several great maggots, the offspring
of these flies, issuing from their nostrils, gave
them relief.&mdash;In Jamaica a large blue fly buzzes about the
sick in the last stages of fever; and when they sleep or
doze with their mouths open, the nurses find it very difficult
to prevent these flies from laying their eggs in the
nose, mouth, or gums. An instance is recorded of a
lady who, after recovering from a fever, fell a victim to
the maggots of this fly, which from the nose found their
way through the <i>os cribriforme</i> into the cavity of the skull,
and afterwards into the brain<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>. One of the most shocking
cases of <i>Scolechiasis</i> I ever met with is related in Bell's
<i>Weekly Messenger</i> in the following words: "On Thursday,
June 25, died at Asbornby, (<i>Lincolnshire</i>) John
Page, a pauper belonging to Silk-Willoughby, under
circumstances truly singular. He being of a restless disposition,
and not choosing to stay in the parish workhouse,
was in the habit of strolling about the neighbouring
villages, subsisting on the pittance obtained from door
to door: the support he usually received from the benevolent
was bread and meat; and after satisfying the
cravings of nature, it was his custom to deposit the surplus
provision, particularly the meat, betwixt his shirt
and skin. Having a considerable portion of this provision
in store, so deposited, he was taken rather unwell,
and laid himself down in a field in the parish of
Scredington&mdash;when from the heat of the season at that
time, the meat speedily became putrid, and was of course
struck by the flies: these not only proceeded to devour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the inanimate pieces of flesh, but also literally to prey
upon the living substance; and when the wretched man
was accidentally found by some of the inhabitants, he
was so eaten by the maggots that his death seemed inevitable.
After clearing away as well as they were able
these shocking vermin, those who found Page conveyed
him to Asbornby, and a surgeon was immediately procured,
who declared that his body was in such a state that
dressing it must be little short of instantaneous death;
and in fact the man did survive the operation but a few
hours. When first found, and again when examined by the
surgeon, he presented a sight loathsome in the extreme;
white maggots of enormous size were crawling in and upon
his body, which they had most shockingly mangled, and
the removing of the external ones served only to render
the sight more horrid<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>."&mdash;A medical friend of mine, at
Ipswich, gave me this winter an apode larva voided by a
person of that place with his urine, which I now preserve
in spirits and can show you when you visit me. It appears
to me to belong to the <i>Diptera</i> order, yet not to the fly
tribes (<i>Tanystoma</i>, Latr.), but rather to the <i>Tipulari√¶</i> of
that author, with which however it does not seem to
agree so entirely as to take away all doubt. It is a very
singular larva, and I can find none in any author that I
have had an opportunity of consulting which at all resembles
it. That you may know it, should you chance
to meet with it, I shall here describe it. <i>Body</i>, three
fourths of an inch in length, and about a line in breadth;
opaque, of a pale yellow colour; cylindrical, tapering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
somewhat at each extremity; consisting of twenty articulations
without the head: <i>Head</i> reddish brown, heartshaped,
much smaller than the following joint; armed
with two unguiform mandibles; with a biarticulate palpus
attached exteriorly to the base of each. These mandibles
appear to be moved by a narrow black central
tendon under the dorsal skin terminating a little beyond
the base of the first segment; besides this, there are four
others, two on each side of it, the outer ones diverging,
much slenderer, and very short. The last or anal joint
of the body very minute; exerting two short, filiform
horns, or rather respiratory organs. I could discover, in
this animal, no respiratory plates, such as are found in
the larv√¶ of <i>Muscid√¶</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> nor were the trache√¶ visible.
When given to me, it was alive and extremely active,
writhing itself into various contortions with great agility.
It moved, like other dipterous larv√¶, by means of its
mandibles. Upon wetting my fingers more than once,
to take it up when it had fallen from a table upon which
it was placed, the saline taste with which it was imbued
was so powerful that it was some time before it was dissipated
from my mouth.&mdash;I shall only mention one more
instance, because it is a singular one. The larva of
<i>Helophilus pendulus</i>, a fly peculiarly formed by nature
for inhabiting fluids, has been found in the stomach of a
woman<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>.</p>

<p>You will smile when I tell you that I have met with the
prescription of a famous urine-doctor, in which he recommends
to his credulous patient to take a certain number
of <i>sow bugs</i> per diem, by this name distinguishing, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
suppose, the pill-millepede (<i>Armadillo vulgaris</i>), once a
very favourite remedy. What effect they produced in
this case I was not informed; but the learned Bonnet
relates that he had seen a certificate of an English physician,
dated July 1763, stating that, some time before, a
young woman who had swallowed these animals alive, as
is usually done, threw up a prodigious number of them
of all sizes, which must have bred in her stomach<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>.&mdash;Another
apterous species appears to have been detected
in a still more remarkable situation. Hermann, the
author of the admirable <i>M√©moire Apterologique</i>, whose
untimely death is so much to be lamented, informs us
that an Acarus figured and described in his work (<i>A.
marginatus</i>), was observed by his artist running on the
<i>corpus callosum</i> of the <i>brain</i> of a patient in the military
hospital at Strasbourg, which had been opened but a
minute before and the two hemispheres and the <i>pia mater</i>
just separated. He adds that this is not the first time
that insects have been found in the brain. Cornelius
Gemma, in his <i>Cosmocritica</i>, p. 241, says that on dissecting
the brain of a woman there were found in it abundance
of vermicles and <i>punaises</i><a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.</p>

<p>It was customary in many countries in ancient times
to punish certain malefactors by exposing them to be devoured
by wild beasts: but to expose them to <i>insects</i> for
the same purpose was a refinement in cruelty, which
seems to have been peculiar to the despots of Persia.
We are informed that the most severe punishment
amongst the Persians was that of shutting up the offender
between two boats of equal size; they laid him in one of
them upon his back, and covered him with the other, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
hands, feet, and head being left bare. His face, which
was placed full in the sun, they moistened with honey,
thus inviting the flies and wasps, which tormented him
no less than the swarms of maggots that were bred in his
excrements and body, and devoured him to the very entrails.
He was compelled to take as much food as was
necessary to support life, and thus existed sometimes for
several days. Plutarch informs us that Mithridates, whom
Artaxerxes Longimanus condemned to this punishment,
lived seventeen days in the utmost agony; and that, the
uppermost boat being taken off at his death, they found
his flesh all consumed, and myriads of worms gnawing
his bowels<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. Could any natural objects be made more
horrible and effectual instruments of torture than <i>insects</i>
were in this most diabolical invention of tyranny?</p>

<p>In this enumeration of evils derived from insects, I
must not wholly pass over the serious and sometimes
fatal effects produced upon some persons by eating honey,
or even by drinking mead. I once knew a lady upon
whom these acted like poison, and have heard of instances
in which death was the consequence. Sometimes, when
bees extract their honey from poisonous plants, such results
have not been confined to individuals of a particular
habit or constitution. A remarkable proof of this is given
by Dr. Barton in the fifth volume of <i>The American Philosophical
Transactions</i>. In the autumn and winter of the
year 1790, an extensive mortality was produced amongst
those who had partaken of the honey collected in the
neighbourhood of Philadelphia. The attention of the
American Government was excited by the general distress,
a minute inquiry into the cause of the mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
ensued, and it was satisfactorily ascertained that the
honey had been chiefly extracted from the flowers of
<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>.</p>

<p>Amongst other <i>direct</i> injuries occasioned by these
creatures, perhaps, out of regard for the ladies, I ought
to notice the alarm which many of them occasion to the
loveliest part of the creation. When some females retire
from society to avoid a wasp; others faint at the sight
of a spider; and others, again, die with terror if they
hear a death-watch: these groundless apprehensions and
superstitious alarms are as much real evils to those who
feel them, as if they were well founded. But having
already adverted to this subject, I shall here only quote
the observation of a wise man, that "Fear is a betraying
of the succours that reason offereth<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>." The best remedy,
therefore, in such cases is going to reason for succour.
In a few instances, indeed, the evil may take root in a
constitutional defect, for there seems to be some foundation
for the doctrine of natural antipathies: but, generally
speaking, in consequence of the increased attention to
Natural History, the reign of imaginary evils is ceasing
amongst us, and what used to shake the stout hearts of
our superstitious ancestors with anile terrors, is become
a subject of interesting inquiry to their better informed
descendants, even of the weaker sex.</p>

<p>And now, my friend, I flatter myself you feel disposed
to own the truth of my position, however it might startle
you at first, and will candidly acknowledge that I have
proved the empire of these despised insects over man's
person: and that, instead of being a race of insignificant
creatures, which we may safely overlook, as having no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
concern with, they may, in the hands of Divine Providence,
and even of man, become to us fearful instruments
of evil and of punishment. I shall next endeavour to
give you some idea of the <i>indirect</i> injuries which they
occasion us by attacking our property, or interfering with
our pleasure or comfort&mdash;but this must be the subject of
another letter.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_V" id="LETTER_V">LETTER V.</a></h2>

<h3><i>INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>INDIRECT INJURIES.</h5>


<p>Having detailed to you the <i>direct</i> injuries which we
suffer from insects, I am now to call your attention to
their <i>indirect</i> attacks upon us, or the injury which they
do our property; and under this view also you will own,
with the fullest conviction, that they are not beings that
can with prudence or safety be disregarded or despised.
Our property, at least that part exposed to the annoyance
of these creatures, may be regarded as consisting of
animal and vegetable productions, and that in two states;
when they are living, namely, and after they are dead. I
shall therefore endeavour to give you a sketch of the mischief
which they occasion, first to our <i>living animal</i> property,
then to our <i>living vegetable</i> property; and lastly
to our <i>dead stock</i>, whether animal or vegetable.</p>

<p>Next to our own persons, the <i>animals</i> which we employ
in our business or pleasures, or fatten for food, individually
considered, are the most valuable part of our
possessions&mdash;and at certain seasons, hosts of insects of
various kinds are incessant in their assaults upon most
of them.&mdash;To begin with that noble animal the <i>horse</i>.&mdash;See
him, when turned out to his pasture, unable to touch
a morsel of the food he has earned by his labours. He
flies to the shade, evidently in great uneasiness, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
stands continually stamping from the pain produced by
the insertion of the weapons sheathed in the proboscis of
a little fly (<i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>) before noticed as attacking
ourselves<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>. This alights upon him sometimes in one
place and sometimes in another, and never lets him rest
while the day lasts.&mdash;See him again when in harness and
travelling. He is bathed in blood flowing from innumerable
wounds made by the knives and lancets of
various horse-flies (<i>Tabanus</i>, L.), which assail him as he
goes, and allow him no respite<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>; and consider that even
this is nothing to what he suffers in other climates from
the same pest. In North America, vast clouds of different
species&mdash;so abundant as to obscure every distant
object, and so severe in their bite as to merit the appellation
of burning flies&mdash;cover and torment the horses to
such a degree as to excite compassion even in the hearts
of the pack-horsemen. Some of them are nearly as big
as humble-bees; and, when they pierce the skin and
veins of the unhappy beast, make so large an orifice that,
besides what they suck, the blood flows down its neck,
sides, and shoulders in large drops like tears, till, to use
Bartram's expression, "they are all in a gore of blood."
Both the dog-tick and the American tick before mentioned,
especially the latter, also infest the horse. Kalm
affirms, that he has seen the under parts of the belly,
and other places of the body, so covered by them, that
he could not introduce the point of a knife between
them. They were deeply buried in the flesh; and in
one instance that he witnessed, the miserable creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
was so exhausted by continual suction, that it fell, and
afterwards died in great agonies<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>No quadruped is more infested by the gad-fly, sometimes
also improperly called the breese<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>, than the horse.
In this country no fewer than three species attack it.
The most common sort, known by the name of the horse-bee
(<i>Gasterophilus Equi</i>), deposits its eggs (which being
covered with a slimy substance adhere to the hairs) on
such parts of the body as the animal can reach with its
tongue; and thus, unconscious of what it is doing, it unwarily
introduces into its own citadel the troops of its
enemy.&mdash;Another species (<i>G. h√¶morrhoidalis</i>) is still
more troublesome to it, ovipositing upon the lips; and
in its endeavours to effect this, from the excessive titillation
it occasions, giving the poor beast the most distressing
uneasiness. At the sight of this fly horses are always
much agitated, tossing their heads about in the air to
drive it away; and, if this does not answer, galloping off
to a distant part of their pasture, and, as their last resource,
taking refuge in the water, where the gad-flies
never follow them. We learn from Reaumur, that in
France the grooms, when they observe any bots (which
is the vulgar name for the larv√¶ and pup√¶ of these flies)
about the anus of a horse or in its dung, thrust their
hand into the passage to search for more; but this seems
a useless precaution, which must occasion the animal
great pain to answer no good end: for when the bots
are passing through the body, having ceased feeding,
they can do no further injury. In Sweden, as De Geer
informs us, they act much more sensibly: those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
have the care of horses are accustomed to clean their
mouths and throats with a particular kind of brush, by
which method they free them from these disagreeable
inmates before they have got into the stomach, or can be
at all prejudicial to them<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>Providence has doubtless created these animals to answer
some beneficial purpose; and Mr. Clark's judicious
conjectures are an index which points to the very kind
of good our cattle may derive from them, as acting the
part of perpetual stimuli or blisters: yet when they
exceed certain limits, as is often the case with similar
animals employed for purposes equally beneficial, they
become certainly the causes of disease, and sometimes
of death.</p>

<p>How troublesome and teasing is that cloud of flies
(<i>Anthomyia meteorica</i>) which you must often have noticed
in your summer rides, hovering round the head and
neck of your horse, accompanying him as he goes, and
causing a perpetual tossing of the former<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>!&mdash;And still
more annoying in Lapland, as we learn from Linn√©<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>, is
the furious assault of the minute horse-gnat, (<i>Culex equinus</i>,
L.) which infests these beasts in infinite numbers,
running under the mane and amongst the hair, and
piercing the skin to suck their blood.&mdash;An insect of the
same genus is related to attack them in a particular district
in India in so tremendous a manner as to cause
incurable cancers, which finally destroy them<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.&mdash;But of
all the insect tormentors of these useful creatures, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
is none more trying to them than the forest-fly (<i>Hippobosca
equina</i>). Attaching themselves to the parts least
covered with hair, particularly under the belly between
the hind legs, they irritate the quietest horse, and make
him kick so as often to hazard the safety of his rider
or driver. This singular animal runs sideways or backwards
like a crab; and, being furnished with an unusual
number of claws, it adheres so firmly that it is not
easy to take it off; and even if you succeed in this, its
substance is so hard, that by the utmost pressure of your
finger and thumb it is difficult to kill it; and if you let
it go with life, it will immediately return to the charge.&mdash;Amongst
the insect plagues of horses, I should also
have enumerated the larva of <i>Lixus paraplecticus</i>, which
Linn√© considers as the cause of the equine disease,
called in Sweden, after the <i>Phellandrium aquaticum</i>,
"<i>St√¢kra</i>," had not the observations of the accurate De
Geer rendered it doubtful whether the insect be at all
connected with this malady<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.</p>

<p>Another quadruped contributing greatly to our domestic
comfort, from which we derive a considerable portion
of our animal food, and which, on account of its patient
and laborious character when employed in agriculture, is
an excellent substitute for the horse, (you will directly
perceive I am speaking of the <i>ox</i>, whether male or female,)
is also not exempt from insect domination. At certain
seasons the whole terrified herd, with their tails in the
air, or turned upon their backs, or stiffly stretched out
in the direction of the spine, gallop about their pastures,
making the country re-echo with their lowings, and finding
no rest till they get into the water. Their appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and motions are at this time so grotesque, clumsy,
and seemingly unnatural, that we are tempted rather to
laugh at the poor beasts than to pity them, though evidently
in a situation of great terror and distress. The
cause of all this agitation and restlessness is a small gad-fly
(<i>&#338;. Bovis</i>), less than the horse-bee, the object of
which, though it be not to bite them, but merely to oviposit
in their hides, is not put into execution without
giving them considerable pain.</p>

<p>When oxen are employed in agriculture, the attack
of this fly is often attended with great danger, since they
then become perfectly unmanageable; and, whether in
harness or yoked to the plough, will run directly forward.
At the season when the &#338;strus infests them,
close attention should be paid, and their harness so constructed
that they may easily be let loose.</p>

<p>Reaumur has minutely described the ovipositor, or singular
organ by which these insects are enabled to bore a
round hole in the skin of the animal and deposit their
eggs in the wound. The anus of the female is furnished
with a tube of a corneous substance, consisting of four
pieces, which, like the pieces of a telescope, are retractile
within each other. The last of these terminates in five
points, three of which are longer than the others, and
hooked: when united together they form an instrument
very much like an auger or gimlet; only, having these
points, it can bite with more effect<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. He thinks the infliction
of the wound is not attended by much pain, except
where very sensible nerves are injured, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
animal, appearing to be seized with a kind of phrensy,
begins to gambol, and run with such swiftness that nothing
can stop it. From this semblance of temporary
madness in oxen when pursued and bored by the &#338;strus,
the Greeks applied the term to any sudden fit of fury or
violent impulse in the human species, calling such ebullitions
an <i>&#338;strus</i>. The female fly is observed to be very
expeditious in oviposition, not more than a few seconds;
and while she is performing the operation, the animal
attempts to lash her off, as it does other flies, with its
tail. The circular hole, made by the auger just described,
always continues open, and increases in diameter as the
larva increases in size; thus enabling it to receive a sufficient
supply of air by means of its anal respiratory
plates, which are usually near the orifice.&mdash;But though
these insects thus torment and terrify our cattle, they do
them no material injury. Indeed they occasion considerable
tumours under the skin, where the bots reside,
varying in number from three or four to thirty or forty;
but these seem unattended by any pain, and are so far
from being injurious, that they are rather regarded as
proofs of the goodness of the animal, since these flies
only attack young and healthy subjects. The tanners also
prefer those hides that have the greatest number of bot-holes
in them, which are always the best and strongest<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.</p>

<p>The Stomoxys, and several of the other flies before
enumerated, as well as the dog and American ticks, are
as prejudicial to the ox as to the horse. One species of
Hippobosca I have reason to believe is appropriated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
them; yet, since a single specimen only has hitherto been
taken<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>, little can be said with respect to it.&mdash;A worse pest
than any hitherto enumerated, is a minute fly, concerning
the genus of which there is some doubt, Fabricius
considering it as a Rhagio, (<i>R. columbaschensis</i>,) and
Latreille as a Simulium<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>; but to whatever genus it may
belong, it is certainly a most destructive little creature.
In Servia and the Bannat it attacks the cattle in infinite
numbers, penetrates, according to Fabricius, their generative
organs, but according to other accounts their nose
and ears, and by its poisonous bite destroys them in the
short space of four or five hours. Much injury was sustained
in 1813 from this insect in the palatinate of Arad
in Hungary and in the Bannat; in Banlack not fewer
than two hundred horned cattle perishing from its attacks,
and in Versetz, five hundred. It appears towards the
latter end of April or beginning of May in such indescribable
swarms as to resemble clouds, proceeding as
some think from the region of Mehadia, but according
to others from Turkey. Its approach is the signal for
universal alarm. The cattle fly from their pastures; and
the herdsman hastens to shut up his cows in the house,
or, when at a distance from home, to kindle fires, the
smoke of which is found to drive off this terrible assailant.
Of this the cattle are sensible, and as soon as attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
run towards the smoke, and are generally preserved
by it<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.</p>

<p>Tabani in this country do not seem to annoy our oxen
so much as they do our horses: perhaps for this immunity
they may be indebted to the thickness of their hides;
but Virgil's beautiful description of the annoyance that
the Grecian &#338;strus, called by the Romans Asilus, belongs
evidently to one of the <i>Tabanid√¶</i>. As the passage has
not been very correctly translated, I shall turn poet on
the occasion, and attempt to give it you in a new dress.</p>

<p>In some parts of Africa also insects of this tribe do
incredible mischief. What would you think, should you
be told that one species of fly drives both inhabitants
and their cattle from a whole district? Yet the terrible
<i>Tsaltsalya</i> or <i>Zimb</i> of Bruce (and the world seems now
disposed to give more credit to the accounts of that traveller)
has power to produce such an effect. This fly,
which is a native of Abyssinia, both from its habits and
the figure, appears to belong to the <i>Tabanid√¶</i>, and perhaps
is congenerous with the <i>&#338;strus</i> of the Greeks<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<p>Small as this insect is, we must acknowledge the elephant,
rhinoceros, lion and tiger vastly his inferior. The
appearance, nay the very sound of it occasions more
trepidation, movements and disorder both in the human
and brute creation, than whole herds of the most ferocious
wild beasts in tenfold greater numbers than they
ever are would produce. As soon as this plague appears,
and their buzzing is heard, all the cattle forsake their
food, and run wildly about the plain till they die worn
out with fatigue, fright, and hunger. No remedy remains
for the residents on such spots but to leave the
black earth and hasten down to the sands of Atbara, and
there they remain while the rains last. Camels, and
even elephants and rhinoceroses, though the two last
coat themselves with an armour of mud, are attacked by
this winged assassin and afflicted with numerous tumours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
All the inhabitants of the sea-coast of Melinda down to
Cape Gardefui, to Saba and the south of the Red Sea,
are obliged in the beginning of the rainy season to remove
to the next sand to prevent all their stock of cattle
from being destroyed. This is no partial emigration&mdash;the
inhabitants of all the countries from the mountains
of Abyssinia northward, to the confluence of the Nile
and Astaboras, are once a year obliged to change their
abode and seek protection in the sands of Beja; nor is
there any alternative or means of avoiding this, though
a hostile band were in the way capable of spoiling them
of half their substance<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>. This fly is truly a Beelzebub<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>:
and perhaps it was this, or some species related to it,
that was the prototype of the Philistine idol worshiped
under that name and in the form of a fly.</p>

<p>I must not conclude this subject of insects hurtful to
our cattle, without noticing a beetle much talked of by
the ancients for its mischievous properties in this respect.
You will soon and rightly conjecture that I am speaking
of the Buprestis<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>, so called from the injury which it has
been supposed to occasion to oxen or kine.</p>

<p>Modern writers have been much divided in their opinion
to what genus this celebrated insect belongs. All
indeed have regarded it as of the <i>Coleoptera</i> order; but
here their agreement ceases. Linn√© should seem to
have looked upon it as a species of the genus to which
he has given its name; but these, being timber insects,
are not very likely to be swallowed by cattle with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
food. Geoffroy thinks it to be a <i>Carabus</i> or <i>Cicindela</i>,
but with as little reason, since the species of these genera
do not feed amongst the herbage; and though they are
sometimes found running there, yet their motions are so
rapid, that it is not very likely that cattle would often
swallow them while feeding.</p>

<p>M. Latreille, in an ingenious essay on this insect<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>,
suspects it to belong to the genus <i>Mel√∂e</i>, and as this
feeds upon herbs, (<i>M. Proscarab√¶us</i> and <i>M. violaceus</i>,
upon the Ranunculi, so widely disseminated in our pastures,)
his opinion seems to rest upon more solid grounds
than that of his predecessors; but yet I think the insect
in question rather belongs to <i>Mylabris</i>, and for the following
reason.</p>

<p>In order rightly to ascertain what insect this really
was, we must endeavour to trace it in the country in
which it received its name and character. This country
was certainly Greece; and there such an animal, retaining
nearly its old name, and accused of being the
cause of the same injury to cattle, still exists. For Belon
informs us that on Mount Athos there is found a winged
insect like the blister-beetle, but yellow, larger, and of a
very offensive smell, which feeds upon various plants,
and is called <i>Voupristi</i> by the Caloyers or Monks, who
assert that when horses or other cattle even feed upon
the herbs which the animals have touched, they die from
inflammation, and that it is an immediate poison to
oxen<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. This therefore most probably was the Buprestis
of the Greek writers; and as Pliny usually compiled
from them, it may be regarded as his also, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
tells us was a caustic insect and prepared in the same
manner as the blister-beetle<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>. He further observes that
it was scarce in Italy. The Greek insect of Mount Athos
M. Latreille supposes to be a Mylabris, and in this I
agree with him; and therefore this is the proper genus
to which the original Greek Buprestis, the true type of
the insect in question, ought to be referred, and not
Mel√∂e.</p>

<p>Whether this animal be really guilty to the extent of
which it is accused, admits of considerable doubt; but
as I have not the means of ascertaining this, I shall leave
the question for others who are better informed to
decide.</p>

<p>But, of all our cattle none are more valuable and important
to us than our <i>flocks</i>; to them we look not only
for a principal part of our food, but also for clothing
and even light. Thick as is their coat of wool, it does
not shield them from the attack of all-subduing insects:
on the contrary it affords a comfortable shelter to one of
their enemies of this class, regarded by Linn√© as a species
of <i>Hippobosca</i>, but properly separated from that genus
by Latreille under the name of <i>Melophagus</i><a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>. This
is commonly called the sheep-louse, and is so tenacious
of life, that we are told by Ray it will exist in a fleece
twelve months after it is shorn, and its excrements are said
to give a green tinge to the wool very difficult to be discharged.&mdash;You
have doubtless often observed in the
heat of the day the sheep shaking their heads and striking
the ground violently with their fore feet; or running
away and getting into ruts, dry dusty spots or gravel
pits, where crowding together they hold their noses close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to the ground. The object of all these actions and
movements is to keep the gad-fly appropriated to them
(<i>&#338;. Ovis</i>) from getting at their nostrils, on the inner
margin of which they lay their eggs, from whence the
maggots make their way into the head, feeding in the
maxillary and frontal sinuses on the mucilage there produced.
When full-grown, they fall through the nostrils
to the ground and assume the pupa. Whether the animal
suffers much pain from these troublesome assailants
is not ascertained. Sometimes the maggots make their
way even into the brain. I have been informed by a
very accurate and intelligent friend, that, on opening the
head of one of his sheep which died in consequence of a
vertigo, three maggots were found in it in a line just
above the eyes, and that behind them there was a bladder
of water.&mdash;Perhaps you are not aware that the bots
we are speaking of, or rather those in the head of goats,
have been prescribed as a remedy for the epilepsy, and
that from the tripod of Delphos. Yet so we are told on
the authority of Alexander Trallien. Whether Democrates,
who consulted the oracle, was cured by this remedy
does not appear; the story shows however that the
ancients were aware of the station of these larv√¶.&mdash;The
common saying that a whimsical person is <i>maggoty</i>, or
has got <i>maggots in his head</i>, perhaps arose from the
freaks the sheep have been observed to exhibit when infested
by their bots.&mdash;The flesh-fly is also a great annoyance
to the fleecy tribe, especially in fenny countries;
and if constant attention be not paid them, they are soon
devoured by its insatiable larv√¶. In Lincolnshire, the
principal profit of the druggists is derived from the sale
of a mercurial ointment used to destroy them.&mdash;In tropical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
countries the sheep frequently suffer from the ants.
Bosman relates that when in Guinea, if one of his was
attacked by them in the night, which often happened, it
was invariably destroyed, and was so expeditiously devoured
that in the morning only the skeleton would be
left.</p>

<p>Of our domestic animals the least infested by insects,
I mean as to the number of species that attack it, is the
<i>swine</i>. With the exception of its louse, which seems to
annoy it principally by exciting a violent itching, it is
exposed to scarcely any other plague of this class, unless
we may suppose that it is the biting of flies, which in hot
weather drives it to "its wallowing in the mire."</p>

<p>Under this head we may include the <i>deer</i> tribe, for,
though often wild, those kept in parks may strictly be
deemed domestic; and the rein-deer is quite as much so
to the Laplander, as our oxen and kine are to us. We
learn from Reaumur that the fallow-deer is subject to the
attack of two species of gad-fly<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>: one, which, like that of
the ox, deposits its eggs in an orifice it makes in the
skin of the animal, and so produces tumours; and another
in imitation of that of the sheep, ovipositing in
such a manner that its larv√¶ when hatched can make
their way into the head, where they take their station in
a cavity near the pharynx. He relates a curious notion
of the hunters with respect to these two species. Conceiving
them both to be the same, they imagine that
they mine for themselves a painful path under the skin
to the root of the horns; which is their common rendezvous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
from all parts of the body; where, by uniting their
labours and gnawing indefatigably, they occasion the
annual casting of these ornamental as well as powerful
arms. This fable, improbable and ridiculous as it is,
has had the sanction of grave authorities<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.&mdash;The &#338;stri
last mentioned inhabit, in considerable numbers, two
fleshy bags as big as a hen's egg, and of a similar shape,
near the root of the tongue. Reaumur took between
sixty and seventy bots from one of them, and even then
some had escaped. What other purpose these two remarkable
purses are intended to answer, it is not easy to
conjecture. He supposes that the parent fly must enter
the nostrils of the deer, and pass down the air passages
to oviposit in them: but probably such a man&#339;uvre is
unnecessary, since there seems no reason, supposing the
eggs to be laid in the nostrils, why the larva when
hatched cannot itself make its way down to the above
station, as easily as that of the sheep into the maxillary
sinuses. Or, which perhaps is more likely, when the
animal draws in the air, the eggs or larvae may be carried
down with it, in both cases, to the place assigned to
them by Providence<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.</p>

<p>No animal, however, is so cruelly tormented by &#338;stri
as the <i>rein-deer</i>; for besides one synonymous apparently
with this of the deer (<i>&#338;. nasalis</i>) from which they endeavour
to relieve themselves by snorting and blowing<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
they have a second which produces bots under their
skin; not improbably the same species that in a similar
way attacks the latter, as I have stated above. We have
heard that the vaccine disease is derived from the cow
and the horse, and the small-pox is said to have originated
in the heels of the camel: but neither the ingenious
Dr. Jenner nor any other writer on this subject has
informed us that the rein-deer is subject to the distemper
last named; yet Linn√© quotes the learned work of a
Swedish physician on <i>Syphilis</i>, who gravely gives this as
a fact<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>!! The inoculator, in truth, is the gad-fly, the
tumours it causes are the pustules, and its larv√¶ are the
pus.&mdash;It is astonishing how dreadfully these poor animals
in hot weather are terrified and injured by them:
ten of these flies will put a herd of five hundred into the
greatest agitation. They cannot stand still a minute,
no not a moment, without changing their posture, puffing
and blowing, sneezing and snorting, stamping and
tossing continually; every individual trembling and
pushing its neighbour about. The ovipositor of this fly
is similar to that of the ox-breese, consisting of several
tubular joints which slip into each other; and therefore
Linn√© was probably mistaken in supposing that it lays
its eggs <i>upon</i> the skin of the animal, and that the bot,
when it appears, eats its way through it<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>: there can be
little doubt (or else what is the use of such an apparatus)
that it bores a hole in the skin and there deposits
the eggs. About the beginning of July the rein-deer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
sheds its hair, which then stands erect&mdash;at this time the
fly is always fluttering about it, and takes its opportunity
to oviposit. The bots remain under the skin
through the whole winter, and grow to the size of an
acorn. Six or eight of these are often to be found in a
single rein-deer that has only seen one winter; and these
so emaciate them, that frequently one third of their number
perish in consequence. Even those that are full
grown suffer greatly from this insect. The fly follows
the animals over precipices, valleys, the snow-covered
mountains, and even the highest alps; to which in order
to avoid it they often fly with great swiftness in a direction
contrary to the wind. By this constant agitation
and endeavour to escape from the attack of their enemy
they are kept from eating during the day, standing always
upon the watch, with erect ears and attentive eyes,
that they may observe whether it comes near them<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.
The rein-deer are teased also by a peculiar species of
Tabanus (<i>T. tarandinus</i>) which, by a singular instinct,
instead of their skin, makes its incision in their horns
when tender.</p>

<p>Our <i>dogs</i>, the faithful guardians of our other domestic
animals and possessions, the attached companions of our
walks, and instruments of many of our pleasures and
amusements, cannot defend themselves from insect annoyance.
They have their peculiar louse, and the flea
sucks their blood in common with that of their master:
you must also often have noticed how much they suffer
from the dog-tick, which, when once it has fixed itself
in their flesh, will in a short time, from the size of a pin's
head, so swell itself out by gorging their blood, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
will equal in dimensions what is called the tick-bean. In
the West Indies these ticks, or one like them, get into
the ears and head of the dogs, and so annoy them and
wear them out that they either die or are obliged to be
killed<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the most esteemed dainties of our tables are
supplied from such of the winged part of the creation as
we have domesticated. These also have a louse (<i>Nirmus</i>)
appropriated to them, and the gorgeous peacock
is infested by one of extraordinary dimensions and singular
form<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>. Pigeons, in addition, often swarm with the
bed-bug, which makes it advisable never to have their
lockers fixed to a dwelling-house. In their young, if
your curiosity urges you to examine them, you may find
the larva of the flea, which in its perfect state often
swarms in poultry.</p>

<p>Amongst our most valuable domestic animals I shall
be very unjust and ungrateful, if I do not enumerate
those industrious little creatures the <i>bees</i>, from whose
incessant labours and heaven-taught art we derive the
two precious productions of honey and wax. They also
are infested by numerous insect-enemies, some of which
attack the bees themselves, while others despoil them of
their treasures.&mdash;They have parasites of a peculiar genus,
although at present regarded as belonging to Pediculus<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>,
and mites (<i>Gamasus gymnopterorum</i>) are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
injurious to them. That universal plunderer
the wasp, and his formidable congener the hornet, often
seize and devour them, sometimes ripping open their body
to come at the honey, and at others carrying off that
part in which it is situated. The former frequently takes
possession of a hive, having either destroyed or driven
away its inhabitants, and consumes all the honey it contains.
Nay there are certain idlers of their own species,
called by apiarists corsair-bees, which plunder the hives
of the industrious.&mdash;From the curious account which
Latreille has given us of <i>Philanthus apivorus</i>, a wasp-like
insect, it appears that great havoc is made by it of the
unsuspecting workers, which it seizes while intent upon
their daily labours, and carries off to feed its young<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.
Another insect, which one would not have suspected of
marauding propensities, must here be introduced. Kuhn
informs us, that long ago (in 1799) some monks who
kept bees, observing that they made an unusual noise,
lifted up the hive, when an animal flew out, which to
their great surprise no doubt, for they at first took it for
a bat, proved to be the death's-head hawk-moth (<i>Acherontia
Atropos</i>), already celebrated as the innocent cause
of alarm<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>; and he remembers that several, some years
before, had been found dead in the bee-houses<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>. M. Huber,
also, in 1804 discovered that it had made its way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
into his hives and those of his vicinity, and had robbed
them of their honey. In Africa we are told it has the
same propensity; which the Hottentots observing, in
order to monopolize the honey of the wild bees, have
persuaded the colonists that it inflicts a mortal wound<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.
This moth has the faculty of emitting a remarkable
sound, which he supposes may produce an effect upon
the bees of a hive somewhat similar to that caused by
the voice of their queen, which as soon as uttered strikes
them motionless, and thus it may be enabled to commit
with impunity such devastation in the midst of myriads
of armed bands<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>. The larv√¶ of two species of moth
(<i>Galleria Cereana</i>, and <i>Mellonella</i>) exhibit equal hardihood
with equal impunity. They indeed pass the whole
of their initiatory state in the midst of the combs. Yet
in spite of the stings of the bees of a whole republic,
they continue their depredations unmolested, sheltering
themselves in tubes made of grains of wax, and lined
with silken tapestry, spun and wove by themselves, which
the bees (however disposed they may be to revenge the
mischief which they do them, by devouring, what to all
other animals would be indigestible, their wax,) are unable
to penetrate. These larv√¶ are sometimes so numerous
in a hive, and commit such extensive ravages,
as to force the poor bees to desert it and seek another
habitation.</p>

<p>I shall not delay you longer upon this subject by detailing
what <i>wild animals</i> suffer from insects, further than
by observing that the two creatures of this description in
which we are rather interested, the <i>hare</i> and the <i>rabbit</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
do not escape their attack. The hare in Lapland is
more tormented by the gnats than any other quadruped.
To avoid this pest it is obliged to leave the cover of the
woods in full day, and seek the plains: hence the hunters
say, that of three litters which a hare produces in a
year, the first dies by the cold, the second by gnats, and
only the third escapes and comes to maturity<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.&mdash;We
learn from the ingenious Mr. Clark, that the American
rabbit and hare are infested by the largest species of
&#338;strus<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> yet discovered; and our domestic rabbits sometimes
swarm with the bed-bug. This was the case with
some kept by two young gentlemen at my house last
summer to such a degree, that I found it necessary to
have them killed.</p>

<p>Nor are the <i>inhabitants of the waters</i> sheltered by their
peculiar element from these universal assailants. The
larv√¶ of Dytisci fixing themselves by their suctorious
mandibles to the body of <i>fish</i>, doubtless destroy an infinite
number of the young fry of our ponds. Some species
of salmon (<i>Salmo Fario</i>, L.) are the food of an animal
which Linn√© has arranged under Pediculus; and
probably many others of the finny tribes may, like the
birds, have their peculiar parasites. Even <i>shell-fish</i> do
not escape, for the <i>Nymphon grossipes</i> enters the shell of
the muscle and devours its inhabitant.</p>

<h3><i>INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>INDIRECT INJURIES CONTINUED.</h5>


<p>Having endeavoured to give you some idea of the
mode in which insects establish and maintain their empire
over man and his train of dependent animals, I shall
next call your attention to his <i>living vegetable</i> possessions,
whether the produce of the forest, the field, or the garden;
whether necessary to him for his support, convenient for
his use, or ministering to his comfort, pleasure and delight:&mdash;and
here you will find these little creatures as
busily engaged in the work of mischief as ever, destroying
what is necessary, deranging what is convenient,
marring what is beautiful, and turning what should give
us pleasure into an object of disgust.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the produce of our <i>fields</i>.&mdash;Bread is
called "the staff of life:" yet should divine Providence
in anger be pleased to give the rein to the various insects
which, in the different stages of its growth, attack the
plant producing it, how quickly would this staff be
broken! From the moment that <i>wheat</i> begins to emerge
from the soil, to the time when it is carried into the barn,
it is exposed to their ravages. One of its earliest assailants
in this country is that of which Mr. Walford has
given an account in the <i>Linnean Transactions</i>, taking it
for the wire-worm; but, as Mr. Marsham observed, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
correctly; it being probably the larva of some coleopterous
insect, perhaps of one of the numerous tribe of
<i>Brachyptera</i> or rove-beetles which are not universally carnivorous.
This animal was discovered to infest the wheat
in its earliest stage of growth after vegetation had commenced;
and there was reason to believe that it began even
with the grain itself. It eats into the young plant about an
inch below the surface, devouring the central part; and
thus, vegetation being stopped, it dies. Out of fifty acres
sown with this grain in 1802, ten had been destroyed by
the grub in question so early as October<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.&mdash;Other predaceous
<i>Coleoptera</i> will also attack young corn. This is
done by the larva of <i>Zabrus gibbus</i>, particularly with
respect to wheat. In the spring of 1813 not less than
twelve German hides (<i>Hufen</i>), equal to two hundred and
thirty English acres, were destroyed by it in the canton
of Seeburg, near Halle in Germany; and Germar (who
with other members of the Society of Natural History,
at that place, ascertained the fact,) suspects that it was
the same insect, described by Cooti, an Italian author,
which caused great destruction in Upper Italy in 1776.&mdash;Not
only is the larva, which probably lives in that state
three years, thus injurious; but, what one would not have
expected, the perfect beetle itself attacks the grain when
in the ear, clambering up the stems at night in vast numbers
to get at it.&mdash;Along with the larv√¶ of this insect were
found, in the proportion of about one fourth, those of
another beetle (<i>Melolontha ruficornis</i>), which seemed to
contribute to the mischief<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Markwick has given us the history of a fly that
attacks wheat in a later period of its growth, which, if it
be not indeed the same, appears to be nearly related to
the <i>Musca Pumilionis</i> of Bierkander<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>, (<i>Oscinis</i> F.) accused
by him of being extremely injurious to rye in the
spring. Our insect was discovered on the first sown
wheats early in that season, making its lodgement in the
very heart of the principal stem just above the root, which
stem it invariably destroyed, giving the crop at first a most
unpromising appearance, so that there seemed scarcely
a hope of any produce. But it proved in this and other
instances that year (1791) that the plant, instead of being
injured, derived great benefit from this circumstance;
for, the main stem perishing, the root (which was not
hurt) threw out fresh shoots on every side, so as to yield
a more abundant crop than in other fields where the insect
had not been busy. These flies therefore seem to
belong to our insect benefactors; and I should not have
introduced them here, had it not been probable that in
some instances later in the spring they may attack the
lateral shoots of the wheat, and so be injurious. It is
also not unlikely that the new progeny, which is disclosed
in May, may oviposit in barley or some other spring corn,
which would bring the next generation out in time for
the wheat sown in the autumn.&mdash;These flies are amongst
the last, and, in some seasons, the most numerous, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
take shelter in the windows of our apartments when the
first frosts indicate the approach of winter, previous to
their becoming torpid during that season. When this
little animal was first observed in England, it created no
small alarm amongst agriculturists lest it should prove
to be the <i>Hessian fly</i>, so notorious for its depredations
in North America; but Mr. Marsham, by tracing out
the species, proved the alarm to be unfounded<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>. That
there was sufficient cause for apprehension should it have
so turned out, what I have formerly stated concerning
the latter insect, and the additional facts which I shall
now adduce, will amply show.</p>

<p>The ravages of the animal just alluded to, which was
first noticed in 1776, and received its name from an erroneous
idea that it was carried by the Hessian troops in
their straw from Germany, were at one time so universal
as to threaten, where it appeared, the total abolition of
the culture of wheat; though, by recent accounts, the injury
which it now occasions is much less than at first. It
commences its depredations in autumn, as soon as the
plant begins to appear above ground, when it devours
the leaf and stem with equal voracity until stopped by
the frost. When the return of spring brings a milder
temperature the fly appears again, and deposits its eggs
in the heart of the main stems, which it perforates and
so weakens, that when the ear begins to grow heavy, and
is about to go into the milky state, they break down and
perish. All the crops, as far as it extended its flight, fell
before this ravager. It first showed itself in Long Island,
from whence it proceeded inland at about the rate of fifteen
or twenty miles annually, and by the year 1789 had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
reached 200 miles from its original station. I must observe,
however, that some accounts state its progress at
first to have been very slow, at the rate only of seven
miles per annum, and the damage inconsiderable; and
that the wheat crops were not materially injured by it
before the year 1788. Though these insect hordes traverse
such a tract of country in the course of the year,
their flights are not more than five or six feet at a time.
Nothing intercepts them in their destructive career, neither
mountains nor the broadest rivers. They were seen
to cross the Delaware like a cloud. The numbers of this
fly were so great, that in wheat-harvest the houses swarmed
with them to the extreme annoyance of the inhabitants.
They filled every plate or vessel that was in use; and
five hundred were counted in a single glass tumbler exposed
to them a few minutes with a little beer in it<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p>America suffers also in its wheat and maize from the
attack of an insect of a different order; which, for what
reason I know not, is called the chintz-bug-fly. It appears
to be apterous, and is said in scent and colour to
resemble the bed-bug. They travel in immense columns
from field to field, like locusts destroying every thing as
they proceed: but their injuries are confined to the states
south of the 40th degree of north latitude<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>. From this
account the depredator here noticed should belong to the
tribe of <i>Geocoris√¶</i>, Latr.; but it seems very difficult to
conceive how an insect that lives by suction, and has no
mandibles, could destroy these plants so totally.</p>

<p>When the wheat blossoms, another marauder, to which
Mr. Marsham first called the attention of the public, takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
its turn to make an attack upon it, under the form of an
orange-coloured gnat, which introducing its long retractile
ovipositor into the centre of the corolla, there deposits
its eggs. These being hatched, the larv√¶, perhaps by
eating the pollen, prevent the impregnation of the grain,
and so in some seasons destroy the twentieth part of the
crop<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>.</p>

<p>One would think, when laid up in the barn or in the
granary, that wheat would be secure from injury; but
even there the weevil (<i>Calandra granaria</i>), in its imago
as well as in its larva state, devours it; and sometimes
this pest becomes so infinitely numerous, that a sensible
man, engaged in the brewing trade, once told me, speaking
perhaps rather hyperbolically, that they collected
and destroyed them by bushels; and no wonder, for a
single pair of these destroyers may produce in one year
above 6000 descendants.&mdash;There are three other insects
that attack the stored wheat, which are more injurious
to it than even the weevil. One is a minute species of
moth (<i>Tinea granella</i>), happily not much if at all known
in this country; of which Leeuwenhoek has given us a
full history under the name of the wolf. Another is a
species of the same genus, at present not named, which,
as we are informed by Du Hamel, at one time committed
dreadful ravages in the province of Angoumois
in France. The third is <i>Trogosita caraboides</i>, a kind of
beetle, the grub of which called <i>Cadelle</i>, Olivier tells us,
did more damage to the housed grain in the southern
provinces of France than either the weevil or the wolf<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.&mdash;Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
I may just mention a few other insects which
devour grains that are the food of man, concerning which
I have collected no other facts. The rice-weevil (<i>Calandra
Oryz√¶</i>) is very injurious to the useful grain after
which it is named, as is likewise another small beetle,
<i>Lyctus dentatus</i>, F. (<i>Sylvanus</i>, Latr.): and an Indian grain
called in the country <i>Joharr√©</i>, which appears to be a
species of Holcus or Milium, is the appropriate food of
another species of Calandra<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>, which I found abundant
in it.</p>

<p><i>Rye</i>, in this island, is an article of less importance than
wheat; but in some parts of the continent it forms a principal
portion of the bread-corn. Providence has also appointed
the insect means of causing a scarcity of this species
of food. The fly before noticed (<i>Oscinis Pumilionis</i>)
introduces its eggs into the heart of the shoots of rye, and
occasions so many to perish, that from eight to fourteen
are lost in a square of two feet.&mdash;A small moth also (<i>Margaritia
Secalis</i>) which eats the culm of this plant within
the vagina, thus destroys many ears<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. In common with
wheat and barley it also suffers from Leeuwenhoek's
wolf and the weevil.</p>

<p><i>Barley</i> likewise, another of our most valuable grains,
has several insect foes. The gelatinous larva of a saw-fly
(<i>Tenthredo</i>, L.) preys upon the upper surface of the
leaves, and so occasions them to wither. <i>Musca Hordei</i>
of Bierkander also assails the plant. A tenth part of the
produce of this grain, Linn√© affirms, is annually destroyed
in Sweden by another fly, not yet discovered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Britain, (<i>Oscinis Frit</i>,) which does the mischief by getting
into the ear, as does likewise <i>O. lineata</i>, F.&mdash;A small
species of moth described by Reaumur, though not
named by Linn√©, which may be called <i>Tinea Hordei</i>,
(<i>Ypsolophus granellus?</i>) devours the grain when laid up in
the granary. This fly deposits several eggs, perhaps
twenty or thirty, on a single grain; but as one grain
only is to be the portion of one larva, they disperse when
hatched, each selecting one for itself, which it enters from
without at a place more tender than the rest;&mdash;and this
single grain furnishes a sufficient supply of food to support
the caterpillar till it is ready to assume the pupa.
Concealed within this contracted habitation, the little
animal does nothing that may betray it to the watchful
eye of man, not even ejecting its excrements from its
habitation; so that there may be millions within a heap
of corn, where you would not suspect there was one<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>.</p>

<p>I have not observed that <i>oats</i> suffer from insects, except
from the universal subterranean destroyer of the
grasses, the wire-worm, of which I shall give you a more
full account hereafter; and occasionally from an Aphis.
The only important grain that now remains unnoticed
is the <i>maize</i> or Indian corn. Besides the chintz-bug-fly,
a little beetle<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> (<i>Phaleria cornuta</i>) appears to devour it;
and it has probably other unrecorded enemies. The
Guinea corn of America (<i>Holcus bicolor</i>), as well as other
kinds of grain, is, according to Abbott, often much injured
by the larva of a moth (<i>Noctua frugiperda</i>, Smith),
which feeds upon the main shoot<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to grain <i>pulse</i> is useful to us both when cultivated
in our gardens and in our fields. Peas and beans, which
form so material a part of the produce of the farm, are
exposed to the attack of a numerous host of insect depredators;
indeed the former, on account of their ravages,
is one of the most uncertain of our crops. The animals
from which in this country both these plants suffer most
are the <i>Aphides</i>, commonly called leaf-lice, but which properly
should be denominated plant-lice.&mdash;As almost every
animal has its peculiar <i>louse</i>, so has almost every plant its
peculiar <i>plant-louse</i>; and, next to locusts, these are the
greatest enemies of the vegetable world, and like them are
sometimes so numerous as to darken the air<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>. The multiplication
of these little creatures is infinite and almost
incredible. Providence has endued them with privileges
promoting fecundity, which no other insects possess: at
one time of the year they are viviparous, at another oviparous;
and, what is most remarkable and without parallel,
the sexual intercourse of one original pair serves for all
the generations which proceed from the female for a whole
succeeding year. Reaumur has proved that in five generations
one Aphis may be the progenitor of 5,904,900,000
descendants; and it is supposed that in one year there
may be twenty generations<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>. This astonishing fecundity
exceeds that of any known animal; and we cannot wonder
that a creature so prolific should be proportionably injurious;
some species, however, seem more so than others.
Those that attack wheat, oats, and barley, of which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
are more kinds than one, seldom multiply so fast as to be
very noxious to those plants; while those which attack
pulse spread so rapidly, and take such entire possession,
that the crop is greatly injured, and sometimes destroyed
by them. This was the case with respect to peas in the
year 1810, when the produce was not much more than the
seed sown; and many farmers turned their swine into
their pea-fields, not thinking them worth harvesting. The
damage in this instance was caused solely by the Aphis,
and was universal throughout the kingdom, so that a sufficient
supply for the navy could not be obtained. The
earlier peas are sown, the better chance they stand of
escaping, at least in part, the effects of this vegetable
Phthiriasis.&mdash;Beans are also often great sufferers from
another species of plant-louse, in some districts from its
black colour called the <i>Collier</i>, which begins at the top
of the plant, and so keeps multiplying downwards. The
best remedy in this case, which also tends to set the beans
well, and improves both their quality and quantity, is to
top them as soon as the Aphides begin to appear, and
carrying away the tops to burn or bury them.&mdash;In a late
stage of growth great havoc is often made in peas by the
grub of a small beetle (<i>Bruchus granarius</i>), which will
sometimes lay an egg in every pea of a pod, and thus
destroy it.&mdash;Something similar I have been told (I suspect
it is a short-snouted weevil) occasionally injures
beans. In this country, however, the mischief caused by
the Bruchus is seldom very serious; but in North America
another species (<i>B. Pisi</i>) is most alarmingly destructive,
its ravages being at one time so universal as to put
an end in some places to the cultivation of that favourite
pulse. No wonder then that Kalm should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
thrown into such a trepidation upon discovering some of
these pestilent insects just disclosed in a parcel of peas
he had brought from that country, lest he should be the
instrument of introducing so fatal an evil into his beloved
Sweden<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>. In the year 1780 an alarm was spread in some
parts of France, that people had been poisoned by eating
worm-eaten peas; and they were forbidden by authority
to be exposed for sale in the market: but the fears of
the public were soon removed by the examination of some
scientific men, who found the cause of the injury to be
the insect of which I am now speaking<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. Another species
of Bruchus (<i>B. pectinicornis</i>) devours the peas in
China and Barbary. A leguminous seed, much used
when boiled as food for horses in India, known to Europeans
by the name of <i>Gram</i>, but in the Tamul dialect
called <i>Koloo</i>, and by the Moors <i>Cooltee</i>, is the appropriate
food of a fourth kind of Bruchus, related to the
last, but having the antenn√¶, which in the male are pectinated,
much shorter than the body. It is, perhaps,
<i>B. scutellaris</i>. A parcel of this seed<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> given me by Captain
Green was full of this insect, several grains containing
two. Molina, in his History of Chili, tells us of a
beetle, which he names <i>Lucanus Pilmus</i>, that infests the
beans in that country;&mdash;a circumstance quite at variance
with the habits of the <i>Lucanid√¶</i>, which all prey upon
timber. This insect was probably a <i>Phaleria</i>, in which
genus the mandibles are protruded from the head like
those of <i>Lucanus</i>; and one species, as we have seen
above, feeds upon maize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Great profits are sometimes derived by farmers from
their crops of <i>clover-seed</i>: but this does not happen very
often; for a small weevil, (<i>Apion flavifemoratum</i>,) which
abounds every where at almost all times of the year, feeds
upon the seed of the purple clover, and in most seasons
does the crop considerable damage; so that a plant of the
fairest appearance will, in consequence of the voracity of
this little enemy, produce scarcely any thing. Another
species (<i>Apion flavipes</i>) infests the Dutch or white clover<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.
The young plants of purple clover, when just sprung,
are often, as Mr. Joseph Stickney pointed out to me,
much injured by the same little jumping beetles (<i>Haltica</i>)
that attack the turnips.</p>

<p>But not only, if let loose to the work of destruction,
might insects annihilate our grain and pulse; they would
also deprive the earth of that beautiful green carpet which
now covers it, and is so agreeable and so refreshing to
the sight. When you see a large tract of land lying
fallow, as is sometimes the case in open districts, with no
intervening patches of verdure, how unpleasant and uncomfortable
is it to your eye! What then would be your
sensations, were the whole face of the earth bare, and
not dressed by Flora? But such a state of things would
soon take place, if to punish us, or to teach us thankfulness
to the great Arbiter of our fate, the insects that feed
upon the <i>grass</i> of our pastures were to become as generally
numerous as they are occasionally permitted to do.
One of the worst of these ravagers is the grub of the
common cock-chafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>.)<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> This insect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
which is found to remain in the <i>larva</i> state four years,
sometimes destroys whole acres of grass, as I can aver
from my own observation. It undermines the richest
meadows, and so loosens the turf that it will roll up as if
cut with a turfing-spade. These grubs did so much
injury about seventy years ago to a poor farmer near
Norwich, that the court of that city, out of compassion,
allowed him 25<i>l.</i>, and the man and his servant declared
that he had gathered eighty bushels of the beetle<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>. In
the year 1785 many provinces of France were so ravaged
by them, that a premium was offered by the government
for the best mode of destroying them. They do not confine
themselves to grass, but eat also the roots of corn;
and it is to feast upon this grub more particularly that
the rooks follow the plough.</p>

<p>The larva also of another species of a cognate genus
(<i>Hoplia pulverulenta</i>) is extremely destructive in moist
meadows, rooting under the herbage, so that, the soil
becoming loose, the grass soon withers and dies. Swine
are very fond of these grubs, and will devour vast numbers
of them, and the rooks lend their assistance.</p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, the greatest enemy of our
pastures is the <i>Char√¶as Graminis</i>, which, however, is
said not to touch the foxtail grass. In the years 1740,
1741, 1742, 1748, 1749, they multiplied so prodigiously
and committed such ravages in many provinces of Sweden,
that the meadows became quite white and dry as if a fire
had passed over them<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>. This destructive insect, though
found in this country, is luckily scarce amongst us; but
our northern neighbours appear occasionally to have suffered
greatly from it. In 1759, and again in 1802, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
high sheep farms in Tweedale were dreadfully infested
by a caterpillar, which was probably the larva of this
moth; spots of a mile square were totally covered by
them, and the grass devoured to the root<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the insects I have hitherto mentioned attack
our crops partially, confining themselves to one or two
kinds only; but there are some species which extend
their ravages indifferently to <i>all</i>. Of this description is
the <i>Pyralis? frumentalis</i>, which moth, Pallas tells us, is
an almost universal pest in the government of Kasan in
Russia, often eating the greater part of the spring corn
to the root<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>. To this we are fortunately strangers; but
another, well known by the name of the wire-worm,
causes annually a large diminution of the produce of our
fields, destroying indiscriminately wheat, rye, oats, and
grass<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>. This insect, which has its name apparently from
its slender form, and uncommon hardness and toughness,
is the grub of one of the elastic beetles termed by
Linn√© <i>Elater lineatus</i>, but by Bierkander, to whom we
are indebted for its history, <i>E. Segetis</i><a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>, which name is
now generally adopted. The late ingenious Mr. Paul of
Starston in Norfolk, (well known as the inventor of a
machine<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> to entrap the turnip-beetle, which may be applied
by collectors with great advantage to general purposes,)
has also succeeded in tracing this insect from the
larva to the imago state. His grubs produced <i>Elater
obscurus</i> of Mr. Marsham, which however comes so near
to <i>E. Segetis</i> that it is doubtful whether it be more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
a variety. The other species, however, of the genus have
similar grubs, many of which probably contribute to the
mischief. When told that it lives in its first (or feeding)
state not less than five years, during the greatest part
of which time it is supported by devouring the roots of
grain, you will not wonder that its ravages should be so
extensive, and that whole crops should sometimes be cut
off by it. As it abounds chiefly in newly broken-up land,
though the roots of the grasses supply it with food, it
probably does not do any great injury to our meadows
and pastures<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Here also may be included the larva of the long-legged
gnat (<i>Tipula oleracea</i>), known in many parts by the name
of <i>the grub</i>, which is sometimes very prejudicial to the
grass in marshy lands, and at others not less so to corn.
Reaumur informs us, that in Poitou, in certain years,
the grass of whole districts has been so destroyed by it,
as not to produce the food necessary for the sustenance
of the cattle<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>. In many parts of England, in Holderness
particularly, it cuts off a large proportion of the wheat
crops, especially if sown upon clover-lays<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>. Reaumur
concludes from the observations he made that it lives
solely upon earth, and consequently that the injury which
it occasions, arises from its loosening the roots of corn
and grass by burrowing amongst them: but my friend
Mr. Stickney, the intelligent author of a treatise upon
this insect, is inclined to think from his experiments that
it feeds on the roots themselves. However this may be,
the evil produced is evident; and it appears too from
the observations of the gentleman last mentioned, that
this animal is not killed by lime applied in much larger
doses than usual<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Our national beverage ale, so valuable and heartening
to the lower orders, and so infinitely preferable to ardent
spirits and tea, is indebted to another vegetable, the <i>hop</i>,
for its agreeable conservative bitter. This plant so precious
has numberless enemies in the Lilliputian world
to which I am introducing you. Its roots are subject to
the attack of the caterpillar of a singular species of moth
(<i>Hepiolus Humuli</i>), known to collectors by the name of
the ghost, that sometimes does them considerable injury<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>.&mdash;A
small beetle also (<i>Haltica concinna</i>) is particularly
destructive to the tender shoots early in the year;
and upon the presence or absence of Aphides, known
by the name of <i>the fly</i>, as in the case of peas, the crop of
every year depends; so that the hop-grower is wholly
at the mercy of insects. They are the barometer that
indicates the rise and fall of his wealth.</p>

<p>If the beer-drinker be thus interested in the history of
these animals, equally so is the drinker of tea. Indeed
<i>sugar</i> is an article so universally useful and agreeable,
that what concerns the cane that produces it seems to
concern every one. This also affords a tempting food
to insects. The caterpillar of a white moth, called the
borer, for destroying which a reward of fifty guineas is
offered by the Society of Arts, is in this respect a great
nuisance, as is an unknown species of horned beetle<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.
An ant also (<i>Formica analis</i>) makes a lodgement in the
interior of the sugar-cane in Guinea, and destroys it.&mdash;But
the creature of this class most destructive to the
sugar-cane, is one of the latter genus that does not
devour it, and is therefore improperly called <i>Formica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
saccharivora</i> by Linn√©; but, by making its nest for shelter
under the roots, so injures the plants that they become
unhealthy and unproductive. These insects about
seventy years ago appeared in such infinite hosts in the
island of Granada, as to put a stop to the cultivation of
this plant; and a reward of 20,000<i>l.</i> was offered to any
one who should discover an effectual mode of destroying
them. Their numbers were incredible. They descended
from the hills like torrents, and the plantations, as well
as every path and road for miles, were filled with them.
Many domestic quadrupeds perished in consequence of
this plague. Rats, mice, and reptiles of every kind became
an easy prey to them; and even the birds, which
they attacked whenever they alighted on the ground in
search of food, were so harassed as to be at length unable
to resist them. Streams of water opposed only a
temporary obstacle to their progress, the foremost rushing
blindly on to certain death, and fresh armies instantly
following, till a bank was formed of the carcases
of those that were drowned sufficient to dam up the
waters, and allow the main body to pass over in safety
below. Even the all-devouring element of fire was tried
in vain. When lighted to arrest their route, they rushed
into the blaze in such myriads of millions as to extinguish
it. Those that thus patriotically devoted themselves to
certain death for the common good, were but as the
pioneers or advanced guard of a countless army, which
by their self-sacrifice was enabled to pass unimpeded
and unhurt. The intire crops of standing canes were
burnt down, and the earth dug up in every part of the
plantations. But vain was every attempt of man to effect
their destruction, till in 1780 it pleased Providence at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
length to annihilate them by the torrents of rain which
accompanied a hurricane most fatal to the other West
India Islands. This dreadful pest was thought to have
been imported<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>. Besides these enemies, the sugar-cane
has also its Aphis, which sometimes destroys the whole
crop<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>; and according to Humboldt and Bonpland the
larva of <i>Elater noctilucus</i> feeds in it<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>.</p>

<p>Two other vegetable productions of the New World,
<i>cotton</i> and <i>tobacco</i>, which are also valuable articles of
commerce, receive great injury from the depredations of
insects. M'Kinnen, in his Tour through the West Indies,
states that in 1788 and 1794 two-thirds of the crop
of cotton in Crooked Island, one of the Bahamas, was
destroyed by the <i>chenille</i> (probably a lepidopterous larva);
and the <i>red bug</i>, an insect equally noxious, stained
it so much in some places as to render it of little or no
value. Browne relates that in Jamaica a bug destroys
whole fields of this plant, and the caterpillar of that beautiful
butterfly <i>Helicopis Cupido</i> also feeds upon it<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>. That
of a hawk-moth, <i>Sphinx Carolina</i>, is the great pest of
Tobacco; and it is attacked likewise by the larva of a
moth, <i>Phal√¶na Rhexi√¶</i>, Smith<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>, and by other insects of
the names and kind of which I am ignorant.</p>

<p><i>Roots</i> are another important object of agriculture,
which, however, as to many of them, they may seem to
be defended by the earth that covers them, do not escape
the attack of insect enemies.&mdash;The carrot, which
forms a valuable part of the crop of the sand-land farms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
in Suffolk, is often very much injured, as is also the parsnip,
by a small centipede (<i>Geophilus electricus</i>), and another
polypod (<i>Polydesmus complanatus</i>), which eat into
various labyrinths the upper part of their roots; and
they are both sometimes totally destroyed by the maggot
of some dipterous insect, probably one of the <i>Muscid√¶</i>.
I had an opportunity of noticing this in the month of
July, in the year 1812, in the garden of our valued friend
the Rev. Revett Sheppard of Offton in Suffolk. The
plants appeared many of them in a dying state; and
upon drawing them out of the ground to ascertain the
cause, these larv√¶ were found with their head and half
of their body immersed in the root in an oblique direction,
and in many instances they had eaten off the end
of it.</p>

<p>America has made us no present more extensively beneficial,
compared with which the mines of Potosi are
worthless, than the <i>potato</i>. This invaluable root, which
is now so universally cultivated, is often, in this country,
considerably injured by the two insects first mentioned
as attacking the carrot. The Death's-head-hawk-moth
(<i>Acherontia Atropos</i>) in its larva state feeds upon its
leaves, though without much injury. In America it is
said to suffer much from two beetles (<i>Cantharis cinerea</i>
and <i>vittata</i>), of the same genus with the blister-beetle<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>;
and in the island of Barbadoes some hemipterous insect,
supposed to be a Tettigonia, occasionally attacks them.
In 1734 and 1735 vast swarms of them devoured almost
every vegetable production of that island, particularly
the potato, and thus occasioned such a failure of this excellent
esculent, especially in one parish, that a collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
was made throughout the island for the relief of the
poor, whose principal food it forms.</p>

<p>The chief dependence of our farmers for the sustenance
of their cattle in the winter is another most useful
root, the <i>turnip</i>. And they have often to lament the distress
occasioned by a failure in this crop, of which these
minor animals are the cause. On its first coming up, as
soon as the cotyledon leaves are unfolded, a whole host
of little jumping beetles, composed chiefly of <i>Haltica Nemorum</i>,
called by farmers the <i>fly</i><a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> and <i>black jack</i>, attack
and devour them; so that on account of their ravages
the land is often obliged to be resown, and frequently
with no better success. It has been calculated by an
eminent agriculturist, that from this cause alone the loss
sustained in the turnip crops in Devonshire in 1786 was
not less than 100,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Almost as much damage is
sometimes occasioned by a little weevil (<i>Ceutorhynchus
contractus</i>) which in the same manner pierces a hole in
the cuticle. When the plant is more advanced, and out
of danger from these pygmy foes, the black larva of a
saw-fly takes their place, and occasionally does no little
mischief, whole districts being sometimes nearly stripped
by them; so that in 1783 many thousand acres were on
this account ploughed up<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.&mdash;The caterpillar of the cabbage-butterfly
(<i>Pontia Brassic√¶</i>) is also sometimes found
upon the turnip in great numbers; and Sir Joseph Banks
informs me that forty or fifty of the insects before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
mentioned<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>, called by Mr. Walford the wire-worm, have
been discovered in October just below the leaves in a
single bulb of this plant.&mdash;The small knob or tubercle
often observable on these roots is inhabited by a <i>grub</i>,
which, from its resemblance to one found in similar
knobs on the roots of <i>Sinapis arvensis</i>, from which I
have bred <i>Ceutorhynchus contractus</i> (<i>Curculio</i> Marsh)
and <i>C. assimilis</i>, small weevils nearly related to each
other<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>. This, however, does not seem to affect their
growth. Great mischief is occasionally done to the
young plants by the wire-worm. I was shown a field
last summer in which they had destroyed one-fourth of
the crop, and the gentleman who showed them to me
calculated that his loss by them would be 100<i>l.</i> One
year he sowed a field thrice with turnips, which were
twice wholly, and the third time in great part, cut off
by this insect.&mdash;Whether the disease to which turnips
are subject, in some parts of the kingdom, from the form
of the excrescences into which the bulb shoots, called
<i>fingers and toes</i>, be occasioned by insects, is not certainly
known<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have wandered long enough about the fields to
observe the progress of insect devastation; let us now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
return home to visit the domains of Flora and Pomona,
that we may see whether their subjects are exposed to
equal maltreatment. If we begin with the <i>kitchen-garden</i>,
we shall find that its various productions, ministering so
materially to our daily comfort and enjoyment, almost
all suffer more or less from the attack of the animals we
are considering.&mdash;Thus, the earliest of our table dainties,
radishes, are devoured by the maggot of a fly (<i>Anthomyia
Radicum</i>), and our lettuces by the caterpillars of several
species of moth; one of which is the beautiful tiger-moth
(<i>Euprepia Caja</i>), another the pot-herb-moth (<i>Mamestra
oleracea</i>), a third anonymous, described by Reaumur as
beginning at the root, eating itself a mansion in the stem,
and so destroying the plant before it cabbages<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>. And
when they are come to their perfection and appear fit
for the table, their beauty and delicacy are often marred
by the troublesome earwig, which, insinuating itself into
them, defiles them with its excrements.&mdash;What more
acceptable vegetable in the spring than broccoli? Yet
how dreadfully is its foliage often ravaged in the autumn
by numerous hordes of the cabbage-butterfly! so that,
in an extensive garden, you will sometimes see nothing
left of the leaves except the veins and stalks.&mdash;What
more useful, again, than the cabbage? Besides the same
insect, which injures them in a similar way, in some
countries they are infested by the caterpillar of a most
destructive moth (<i>Mamestra Brassic√¶</i>), to which indeed
I have before alluded<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>; which, not content with the
leaves, penetrates into the very heart of the plant<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.&mdash;One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of the most delicate and admired of all table vegetables,
concerning which gardeners are most apt to pride
themselves, and bestow much pains to produce in perfection,
I mean the cauliflower, is often attacked by a
fly, which ovipositing in that part of the stalk covered
by the earth, the maggots when hatched occasion the
plant to wither and die, or to produce a worthless head<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.
Even when the head is good and handsome, if not carefully
examined previous to being cooked, it is often rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
disgusting by earwigs that have crept into it, or
the green caterpillar of <i>Pontia Rap√¶</i>.</p>

<p>Our peas, beans, carrots, parsnips, turnips, and potatos
are attacked in the garden by the same enemies that
injure them in the fields<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>; I shall therefore dismiss them
without further notice, and point out those which infest
another of our most esteemed kinds of pulse, kidney
beans. These are principally Aphides, which in dry
seasons are extremely injurious to them. The fluid
which they secrete, falling upon the leaves, causes them
to turn black as if sprinkled with soot; and the nutriment
being subtracted from the pods by their constant
suction, they are prevented from coming to their proper
size or perfection. The beans also which they contain
are sometimes devoured by the caterpillar of a small
moth<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>.&mdash;Onions, which add a relish to the poor man's
crusts and cheese, and form so material an ingredient in
the most savory dishes of the rich, are also the favourite
food of the maggot of a fly, that often does considerable
damage to the crop.&mdash;From this maggot (for a supply of
onions containing which I have to thank my friend Mr.
Campbell, surgeon, of Hedon near Hull, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
very injurious, particularly in light soils,) I have succeeded
in breeding the fly, which proves of that tribe of
the Linnean genus <i>Musca</i>, now called <i>Scatophaga</i>. Being
apparently undescribed, and new to my valued correspondent
Count Hoffmansegg to whom I sent it, I call
it <i>S. Ceparum</i><a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.&mdash;The diuretic asparagus, towards the
close of the season, is sometimes rendered unpalatable
by the numerous eggs of the asparagus beetle (<i>Lema Asparagi</i>),
and its larv√¶ feed upon the foliage after the
heads branch out.&mdash;Cucumbers with us enjoy an immunity
from insect assailants; but in America they are deprived
of this privilege, an unascertained species, called
there the cucumber-fly, doing them great injury<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.&mdash;And,
to name no more, mushrooms, which are frequently cultivated
and much in request, often swarm with the maggots
of various <i>Diptera</i> and <i>Coleoptera</i>.</p>

<p>The insects just enumerated are partial in their attacks,
confining themselves to one or two kinds of our
pulse or other vegetables. But there are others that
devour more indiscriminately the produce of our gardens;
and of these in certain seasons and countries we
have no greater and more universal enemy than the caterpillar
of a moth called by entomologists <i>Plusia Gamma</i>,
from its having a character inscribed in gold on its
primary wings, which resembles that Greek letter. This
creature affords a pregnant instance of the power of
Providence to let loose an animal to the work of destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and punishment. Though common with us, it is
seldom the cause of more than trivial injury; but in the
year 1735 it was so incredibly multiplied in France as
to infest the whole country. On the great roads, whereever
you cast your eyes, you might see vast numbers traversing
them in all directions to pass from field to field;
but their ravages were particularly felt in the kitchen-gardens,
where they devoured every thing, whether pulse
or pot-herbs, so that nothing was left besides the stalks
and veins of the leaves. The credulous multitude thought
they were poisonous, report affirming that in some instances
the eating of them had been followed by fatal
effects. In consequence of this alarming idea, herbs
were banished for several weeks from the soups of Paris.
Fortunately these destroyers did not meddle with the
corn, or famine would have followed in their train.
Reaumur has proved that a single pair of these insects
might in one season produce 80,000; so that, were the
friendly Ichneumons removed, to which the mercy of
Heaven has given it in charge to keep their numbers
within due limits, we should no longer enjoy the comfort
of vegetables with our animal food, and probably soon
become the prey of scorbutic diseases<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>.&mdash;I must not
overlook that singular animal the mole-cricket, (<i>Gryllotalpa
vulgaris</i>,) which is a terrible devastator of the produce
of the kitchen-garden. It burrows under ground,
and devouring the roots of plants thus occasions them to
wither, and even gets into hot-beds. It does so much
mischief in Germany, that the author of an old book of
gardening, after giving a figure of it, exclaims, "Happy
are the places where this pest is unknown!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>flowers</i> and <i>shrubs</i>, that form the ornament of our
parterres and pleasure-grounds, seem less exposed to
insect depredation than the produce of the kitchen-garden;
yet still there are not a few that suffer from it.
The foliage of one of our greatest favourites, the <i>rose</i>,
often loses all its loveliness and lustre from the excrements
of the Aphides that prey upon it. The leaf-cutter
bee also (<i>Megachile<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> centuncularis</i>), by cutting pieces
out to form for its young its cells of curious construction,
disfigures it considerably; and the froth frog-hopper
(<i>Cercopis spumaria</i>) aided by the saw-fly of the rose (<i>Hylotoma
Ros√¶</i>) contributes to check the luxuriance of its
growth, and to diminish the splendour of its beauty.&mdash;Reaumur
has given the history of a fly (<i>Merodon Narcissi</i>)
whose larva feeds in safety within the bulbs of the
Narcissus, and destroys them; and also of another,
though he neglects to describe the species, which tarnishes
the gay parterre of the florist, whose delight is
to observe the freaks of nature exhibited in the various
many-coloured streaks which diversify the blossom of
the tulip, by devouring its bulbs<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.&mdash;Ray notices another
mentioned by Swammerdam, probably <i>Bibio hortulana</i>,
which he calls the deadliest enemy of the flowers of the
spring. He accuses it of despoiling the gardens and
fields of every blossom, and so extinguishing the hope
of the year<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>. But you must not take up a prejudice
against an innocent creature, even under the warrant of
such weighty authority; for the insect which our great
naturalist has arraigned as the author of such devastation
is scarcely guilty, if it be at all a culprit, in the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
here alleged against it. As it is very numerous early in
the year, it may perhaps discolour the vernal blossoms,
but its mouth is furnished with no instrument to enable
it to devour them.</p>

<p>In our <i>stoves</i> and <i>greenhouses</i> the Aphides often reign
triumphant; for, if they be not discovered and destroyed
when their numbers are small, their increase becomes
so rapid and their attack so indiscriminate, that every
plant is covered and contaminated by them, beauty being
converted into deformity, and objects before the most
attractive now exciting only nausea and disgust. The
Coccus (<i>C. Hesperidum</i>) also, which looks like an inanimate
scale upon the bark, does considerable injury
to the two prime ornaments of our conservatories, the
orange and the myrtle; drawing off the sap by its pectoral
rostrum, and thus depriving the plant of a portion
of its nutriment, at the same time that it causes unpleasant
sensations in the beholder from its resemblance
to the pustule of some cutaneous disease.</p>

<p>I must next conduct you from the garden into the <i>orchard</i>
and <i>fruitery</i>; and here you will find the same enemies
still more busy and successful in their attempts to
do us hurt.&mdash;The strawberry, which is the earliest and
at the same time most grateful of our fruits, enjoys also
the privilege of being almost exempt from insect injury.
A jumping weevil (<i>Orchestes Fragari√¶</i>) is said by Fabricius
to inhabit this plant; but as the same species is
abundant in this country upon the beech, the beauty of
which it materially injures by the numberless holes which
it pierces in the leaves, and has I believe never been
taken upon the strawberry, it seems probable that Smidt's
specimens might have fallen upon the latter from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
tree<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>. The only insect I have observed feeding upon
this fruit is the ant, and the injury that it does is not
material.&mdash;The raspberry, the fruit of which arrives later
at maturity, has more than one species of these animals
for its foes. Its foliage sometimes suffers much from
the attack of <i>Melolontha horticola</i><a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>, a little beetle related
to the cockchafer: when in flower the footstalks of
the blossom are occasionally eaten through by a more
minute animal of the same order, <i>Byturus tomentosus</i>,
which I once saw prove fatal to a whole crop; and bees
frequently anticipate us, and by sucking the fruit with
their proboscis spoil it for the table.&mdash;Gooseberries
and currants, those agreeable and useful fruits, a common
object of cultivation both to poor and rich, have
their share of enemies in this class. The all-attacking
Aphides do not pass over them, and the former especially
are sometimes greatly injured by them; their excrement
falling upon the berries renders them clammy
and disgusting, and they soon turn quite black from it.
In July 1812 I saw a currant-bush miserably ravaged
by a species of Coccus, very much resembling the Coccus
of the vine. The eggs were of a beautiful pink, and
enveloped in a large mass of cotton-like web, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
could be drawn out to a considerable length. Sir Joseph
Banks lately showed me a branch of the same
shrub perforated down to the pith by the caterpillar of
<i>√Üegeria tipuliformis</i>: the diminished size of the fruit
points out, he observes, where this enemy has been at
work. In Germany, where perhaps this insect is more
numerous, it is said to destroy not seldom the larger
bushes of the red currant<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>. The foliage of these fruits
often suffers much from the black and white caterpillar
of <i>Abraxas grossulariata</i>; (this was the case last spring at
Hull;) but their worst and most destructive enemy, particularly
of the gooseberry, is that of a small saw-fly.
This larva is of a green colour, shagreened as it were
with minute black tubercles, which it loses at its last
moult. The fly attaches its eggs in rows to the underside
of the leaves. When first hatched, the little animals
feed in society; but having consumed the leaf on
which they were born, they separate from each other,
and the work of devastation proceeds with such rapidity,
that frequently, where many families are produced on
the same bush, nothing of the leaves is left but the veins,
and all the fruit for that year is spoiled<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.</p>

<p>Upon the leaves of the cherry, which usually succeeds
the gooseberry, in common with those of the pear and
several other fruit-trees, the slimy larva of another saw-fly
(<i>Tenthredo Cerasi</i>) makes its repast, yet without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the cause of any very material injury. But in North
America a second species nearly related to it, known there
by the name of the <i>slug-worm</i>, has become prevalent to
such a degree as to threaten the destruction not only of
the cherry, but also of the pear, quince, and plum. In
1797 they were so numerous that the smaller trees were
covered by them; and a breeze of air passing through
those on which they abounded became charged with a
very disagreeable and sickening odour. Twenty or
thirty were to be seen on a single leaf; and many trees,
being quite stripped, were obliged to put forth fresh
foliage, thus anticipating the supply of the succeeding
year and cutting off the prospect of fruit<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.&mdash;In some
parts of Germany the cherry-tree has an enemy equally
injurious. A splendid beetle of the weevil tribe (<i>Rynchites
Bacchus</i>) bores with its rostrum through the half-grown
fruit into the soft stone, and there deposits an
egg. The grub produced from it feeds upon the kernel,
and, when about to become a pupa, gnaws its way through
the cherry, and sometimes not one in a thousand escapes<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.
This insect is fortunately rare with us, and has usually
been found upon the black-thorn. The cherry-fly also
(<i>Tephritis Cerasi</i>) provides a habitation for its maggot
in the same fruit, which it invariably spoils<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.</p>

<p>The different varieties of the plum are every year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
more or less injured by Aphides; and a Coccus (<i>C. Persic√¶?</i>)
sometimes so abounds upon them that every twig
is thickly beaded with the red semiglobose bodies of the
gravid females, whose progeny in spring exhaust the
trees by pumping out the sap.</p>

<p>The blossoms of our pear-trees, as we learn from
Mr. Knight, are often rendered abortive by the grub of
a brown beetle: and a considerable quantity of its fruit
is destroyed by that of a small four-winged fly, which
occasions it to drop off prematurely<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>. This would seem
to be a saw-fly, and is probably the species which Reaumur
saw enter the blossom of a pear before it was quite
open, doubtless to deposit its eggs in the embryo fruit.
He often found in young pears, on opening them, a larva
of this genus<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>.&mdash;A little moth likewise is mentioned by
Mr. Forsyth as very injurious to this tree<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>.</p>

<p>But of all our fruits none is so useful and important
as the apple, and none suffers more from insects, which
according to Mr. Knight<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> are a more frequent cause of
the crops failing than frost. The figure-of-eight moth
(<i>Episema c√¶ruleocephala</i>), Linn√© denominates the pest of
Pomona and the destroyer of the blossoms of the apple,
pear, and cherry.&mdash;He also mentions another (<i>Tinea
Corticella</i>) as inhabiting apple-bearing trees under the
bark.&mdash;And Reaumur has given us the history of a species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
common in this country, and producing the same
effect, often to the destruction of the crop, the caterpillar
of which feeds in the centre of our apples, thus occasioning
them to fall<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>. Even the young grafts, I am informed
by an intelligent friend<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>, are frequently destroyed, sometimes
many hundreds in one night, in the nurseries about
London, by <i>Curculio Vastator</i>, Marsh., (<i>Otiorhynchus?
picipes</i>) one of the short-snouted weevils; and the
foundation of canker in full-grown trees is often laid by
the larv√¶ of <i>Semasia W&#339;berana</i><a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>. The sap too is often
injuriously drawn off by a minute Coccus, of which the
female has the exact shape of a muscle-shell (<i>C. arborum
linearis</i>, Geoffr.), and which Reaumur has accurately
described and figured<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>. This species so abounded in
1816 on an apple-tree in my garden, that the whole bark
was covered with it in every part; and I have since been
informed by Joshua Haworth, jun. Esq. of Hull, that it
equally infests other trees in the neighbourhood. Even
the fruit of a golden pippin which he sent me were thickly
beset with it.&mdash;But the greatest enemy of this tree, and
which has been known in this country only since the
year 1787, is the apple-aphis, called by some the <i>Coccus</i>,
and by others the <i>American blight</i>. This is a minute
insect, covered with a long cotton-like wool transpiring
from the pores of its body, which takes its station in the
chinks and rugosities of the bark, where it increases
abundantly, and by constantly drawing off the sap causes
ultimately the destruction of the tree. Whence this
pest was first introduced is not certainly known. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Joseph Banks traced its origin to a nursery in Sloane
Street; and at first he was led to conclude that it had
been imported with some apple-trees from France. On
writing, however, to gardeners in that country, he found
it to be wholly unknown there. It was therefore, if not
a native insect, most probably derived from North America,
from whence apple-trees had also been imported by
the proprietor of that nursery. Whatever its origin, it
spread rapidly. At first it was confined to the vicinity
of the metropolis, where it destroyed thousands of trees.
But it has now found its way into other parts of the kingdom,
particularly into the cyder counties; and in 1810
so many perished from it in Gloucestershire, that, if
some mode of destroying it were not discovered, it was
feared the making of cyder must be abandoned. This
valuable discovery, it is said, has since been made; the
application of the spirit of tar to the bark being recommended
as effectual<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. Sir Joseph Banks long ago extirpated
it from his own apple-trees, by the simple method
of taking off all the rugged and dead old bark, and then
scrubbing the trunk and branches with a hard brush<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.</p>

<p>Our more dainty and delicate fruits, at least such as
are usually so accounted, the apricot, the peach, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
nectarine, originally of Asiatic origin, are not less subject
to the empire of insects than the homelier natives of
Europe. Certain Aphides form a convenient and sheltered
habitation for themselves, by causing portions of
the leaves to rise into hollow red convexities; in these
they reside, and, with their rostrum pumping out the
sap, in time occasion them to curl up, and thus deform
the tree and injure the produce. The fruit is attacked
by various other enemies of this class, against which we
find it not easy to secure it: wasps, earwigs, flies, wood-lice,
and ants, which last communicate to it a disagreeable
flavour, all share with us these ambrosial treasures;
the first of them as it were opening the door, by making
an incision in the rind, and letting in all the rest.&mdash;The
nucleus of the apricot is also sometimes inhabited by the
caterpillar of a moth, which devouring the kernel causes
the fruit to fall prematurely<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>.&mdash;In this country, however,
these fruits may be regarded as mere luxuries, and
therefore are of less consequence; but in North America
they constitute an important part of the general produce,
at least the peach, serving both as food for swine,
and furnishing by distillation a useful spirit. The ravages
committed upon them there by insects are so serious,
that premiums have been offered for extirpating
them. A species of weevil, perhaps a <i>Rynchites</i>, enters
the fruit when unripe, probably laying its eggs within
the stone, and so destroys them. And two kinds of
<i>Zyg√¶na</i>, by attacking the roots do a still greater injury
to the trees<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.&mdash;A Coccus, as it should seem from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
description, imported about thirty years ago from the
Mauritius, or else with the Constantia vine from the
Cape of Good Hope, has destroyed nearly nine-tenths
of the peach-trees in the Island of St. Helena, where
formerly they were so abundant, that, as in North America,
the swine were fed with them. Various means
have been employed to destroy this plague, but hitherto
without success<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>.&mdash;The imperial pine-apple, the glory
of our stoves, and the most esteemed of the gifts of Pomona,
cannot, however precious, be defended from the
injuries of a singular species of mite, the <i>red Spider</i><a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> of
gardeners, (<i>Erythr√¶us telarius</i>) which covers them, and
other stove plants, with a most delicate but at the same
time very pernicious web.&mdash;The olive-tree, so valuable
to the inhabitants of the warmer regions of Europe, often
nourishes in its berries the destructive maggot of a fly
(<i>Oscinis Ole√¶</i>); and the caterpillar of a little moth
(<i>Tinea Oleella</i>), which preys upon the kernel of the
nucleus, occasions them to fall before they are ripe.&mdash;Every
one who eats nuts knows that they are very often
inhabited by a small white grub; this is the offspring of
a weevil (<i>Balaninus Nucum</i>) remarkable for its long and
slender rostrum, with which it perforates the shell when
young and soft, and deposits an egg in the orifice.&mdash;In
France it sometimes happens, when the chestnuts promise
an abundant crop, that the fruit falls before it comes
to maturity, scarcely any remaining upon the trees. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
caterpillar of a moth which eats into its interior is the
cause of this disappointment<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>.&mdash;Of fruits the date has
the hardest nucleus; yet an insect of the same tribe with
the above, that feeds upon its kernel, is armed with jaws
sufficiently strong to perforate it, that it may make its
escape when the time of its change is arrived, and assume
the pupa between the stone and the flesh. The
date is eaten also by a beetle which Hasselquist calls a
<i>Dermestes</i><a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most delicious, and at the same time most
useful, of all our fruits is the grape: to this, as you know,
we are indebted for our raisins, for our currants, for our
wine, and for our brandy; you cannot therefore but feel
interested in its history, and desire to be informed, whether,
like those before enumerated, this choice gift of
Heaven, whose produce "cheereth God and man<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>,"
must also be the prey of insects. There is a singular
beetle, common in Hungary, (<i>Lethrus cephalotes</i>) which
gnaws off the young shoots of the vine, and drags them
backward into its burrow, where it feeds upon them:
on this account the country people wage continual war
with it, destroying vast numbers<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>.&mdash;Three other beetles
also attack this noble plant: two of them, mentioned by
French authors, (<i>Rynchites Bacchus</i> and <i>Eumolpus
Vitis</i>,) devour the young shoots, the foliage and the
footstalks of the fruit, so that the latter is prevented
from coming to maturity<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>; and a third (<i>C. Corruptor</i>,
Host,) by a German, which seems closely allied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<i>Otiorhynchus? picipes</i> before mentioned, if it be not
the same insect. This destroys the young vines, often
killing them the first year; and is accounted so terrible
an enemy to them, that not only the animals but even
their eggs are searched for and destroyed, and to forward
this work people often call in the assistance of their neighbours<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>.&mdash;In
the Crimea the small caterpillar of a <i>Procris</i>
or <i>Ino</i> (lepidopterous genera separated from <i>Sphinx</i>, L.)
related to <i>I. Statices</i>, is a still more destructive enemy.
As soon as the buds open in the spring, it eats its way
into them, especially the fruit buds, and devours the germ
of the grape. Two or three of these caterpillars will so
injure a vine, by creeping from one germ to another,
that it will bear no fruit nor produce a single regular
shoot the succeeding year<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.&mdash;Vine leaves in France are
also frequently destroyed by the larva of a moth (<i>Tortrix
vitana</i>); in Germany another species does great injury
to the young bunches, preventing their expansion by the
webs in which it involves them<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>; and a third (<i>Tortrix
fasciana</i>) makes the grapes themselves its food: a similar
insect is alluded to in the threat contained in Deuteronomy<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>.&mdash;The
worst pest of the vine in this country is its
Coccus (<i>C. Vitis</i>). This animal, which fortunately is not
sufficiently hardy to endure the common temperature of
our atmosphere, sometimes so abounds upon those that
are cultivated in stoves and greenhouses, that their stems
seem quite covered with little locks of white cotton; which
appearance is caused by a filamentous secretion transpiring
through the skin of the animal, in which they envelop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
their eggs. Where they prevail they do great injury
to the plant by subtracting the sap from its foliage and
fruit, and causing it to bleed.&mdash;And to close the list, you
are perfectly aware of the eagerness with which wasps,
flies, and other insects, attack the grapes when ripe, often
leaving nothing but the mere skin for their lordly proprietor.</p>

<p>There are some of these creatures that attack indiscriminately
all fruit-trees. One of these is the <i>Cicada
septendecim</i>, (so called because, according to Kalm, it
appears only once in seventeen years<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.) The female oviposits
in the pith of the twigs of trees, where the grubs
are hatched, and do infinite damage both to fruit- and
forest-trees<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>.&mdash;Another, the caterpillar of the butterfly
of the hawthorn, (<i>Pieris Crat√¶gi</i>) which in 1791, in some
parts of Germany, stripped the fruit-trees in general of
their foliage<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.&mdash;In France also in 1731 and 1732 that
of a moth which seems related to the brown-tail moth
(<i>Arctia ph√¶orh&#339;a</i>), whose history has been given by the
late Mr. Curtis, was so numerous as to occasion a general
alarm. The oaks, elms, and white-thorn hedges
looked as if some burning wind had passed over them and
dried up their leaves; for, the insect devouring only one
surface of them, that which is left becomes brown and dry.
They also laid waste the fruit-trees, and even devoured
the fruit; so that the parliament published an edict to
compel people to collect and destroy them; but this would
in a great measure have been ineffectual, had not some
cold rains fallen, which so completely annihilated them,
that it was difficult to meet with a single individual<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>If we quit the orchard and fruit-garden for a walk in
our <i>plantations</i> and <i>groves</i>, we shall still be forced to
witness the sad effects of insect devastation; and when
we see, as sometimes happens, the hedges and trees entirely
deprived of their foliage, and ourselves of the shade
we love from the fervid beam of the noon-day sun; when
the singing birds have deserted them; and all their music,
which has so often enchanted us by its melody, variety,
and sweetness, has ceased&mdash;we shall be tempted in our
hearts to wish the whole insect race was blotted from the
page of creation. Numerous are the agents employed
in this work of destruction. Amongst the beetles, various
cockchafers (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, <i>Amphimalla solstitialis</i>,
and <i>Phyllopertha horticola</i>) in their perfect state act as
conspicuous a part in injuring the trees, as their grubs
do in destroying the herbage. Besides the leaves of
fruit-trees, they devour those of the sycamore, the lime,
the beech, the willow, and the elm. They are sometimes,
especially the common one, astonishingly numerous.
Mouffet relates (but one would think that there
must be some mistake in the date, since they are never so
early in their appearance,) that on the 24th of February
1574 such a number of them fell into the river Severn
as to stop the wheels of the water-mills<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>. It is also recorded
in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, that in 1688
they filled the hedges and trees of part of the county of
Galway in such infinite numbers, as to cling to each other
in clusters like bees when they swarm; on the wing they
darkened the air, and produced a sound like that of distant
drums. When they were feeding, the noise of their
jaws might be mistaken for the sawing of timber. Travellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and people abroad were very much annoyed by
their continual flying in their faces; and in a short time
the leaves of all the trees for some miles round were so
totally consumed by them, that at Midsummer the country
wore the aspect of the depth of winter<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.</p>

<p>But the criminals to whom it is principally owing that
our groves are sometimes stripped of the green robe of
summer, are the various tribes of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, especially
the night-fliers or moths, myriads of whose caterpillars, in
certain seasons, despoil whole districts of their beauty,
and our walks of all their pleasure. In 1731 the oaks
in France were terribly devastated by the larva of <i>Hypogymna
dispar</i><a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>, and in 1797 many of the pine forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
about Bayreuth suffered a similar injury from that of
<i>H. Monacha</i><a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>. Those of Germany are also sometimes laid
waste by the caterpillar of a beautiful moth belonging to
the <i>Noctuid√¶</i> (<i>Achatea spreta</i><a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>), which has been taken in
England. <i>Cheimatobia brumata</i> is likewise a fearful enemy
to the foliage of almost every kind of tree<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>. The woods
in certain provinces of North America are in some years
entirely stripped by that of another moth, which eats all
kinds of leaves. This happening at a time of the year
when the heat is most excessive is attended by fatal consequences.
For, being deprived of the shelter of their
foliage, whole forests are sometimes entirely dried up
and ruined<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>.&mdash;The brown-tail moth, before alluded to,
which occasionally bares our hawthorn hedges, has been
rendered famous by the alarm it caused to the inhabitants
of the vicinity of the metropolis in 1782, when rewards
were offered for collecting the caterpillars, and the
churchwardens and overseers of the parishes attended
to see them burnt by bushels.&mdash;You may have observed
perhaps in some cabinets of foreign insects an ant, the
head of which is very large in proportion to the size of
its body, with a piece of leaf in its mouth many times
bigger than itself. These ants, called in Tobago parasol
ants (<i>&#338;codoma cephalotes</i>), cut circular pieces out of the
leaves of various trees and plants, which they carry in
their jaws to their nests, and they will strip a tree of its
leaves in a night, a circumstance which has been confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to me by Captain Hancock<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. Stedman mentions
another very large ant, being at least an inch in length,
which has the same instinct. It was a pleasant spectacle,
he observes, to behold this army of ants marching constantly
in the same direction, and each individual with its
bit of green leaf in its mouth<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>. The injury thus caused
to trees by insects is not confined to the mere loss of
their leaves for one season; for it occasions them to draw
upon the funds of another, by sending forth premature
shoots and making gems unfold, that, in the ordinary
course, would not have put forth their foliage till the following
year.</p>

<p>Other insects, though they do not entirely devour the
leaves of trees and plants, yet considerably diminish their
beauty. Thus, for instance, sometimes the subcutaneous
larv√¶ undermine them, when the leaf exhibits the whole
course of their labyrinth in a pallid, tortuous, gradually
dilating line&mdash;at others the Tortrices disfigure them by
rolling them up, or the leaf-cutter bees by taking a piece
out of them, or certain Tine√¶ again by eating their under
surface, and so causing them to wither either partially
or totally. You have doubtless observed what is
called the honey-dew upon the maple and other trees,
concerning which the learned Roman naturalist Pliny
gravely hesitates whether he shall call it the sweat of the
heavens, the saliva of the stars, or a liquid produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the purgation of the air<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>!! Perhaps you may not be
aware that it is a secretion of Aphides, whose excrement
has the privilege of emulating sugar and honey in sweetness
and purity. It however often tarnishes the lustre
of those trees in which these insects are numerous, and
is the lure that attracts the swarms of ants which you
may often see travelling up and down the trunk of the
oak and other trees. The larch in particular is inhabited
by an Aphis transpiring a waxy substance like filaments
of cotton: this is sometimes so infinitely multiplied upon
it as to whiten the whole tree, which often perishes in
consequence of its attack. The beech is infested by a
similar one. Some animals also of this genus inhabiting
the poplar, elm, lime, and willow, reside in galls they
have produced, that disfigure the leaves or their footstalks.
Perhaps those resembling fruit, or flowers, or
moss, produced by the Aphis of the fir (<i>Aphis Abietis</i>),
the different species of gall-gnats (<i>Cecidomyia</i>), or occasioned
by the puncture and oviposition of the various
kinds of gall-flies (<i>Cynips</i>), may be regarded rather as
an ornament than as an injury to a tree or shrub; yet
when too numerous they must deprive it of its proper
nutriment, and so occasion some defect. And probably
the enormous wens, and other monstrosities and deformities
observable in trees, may have been originally produced
by the bite or incision of insects.</p>

<p>Besides exterior insect enemies, living trees are liable
to the ravages of many that are <i>interior</i>. The caterpillar
of the great goat-moth (<i>Cossus ligniperda</i><a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>), of the hornet
hawk-moth (<i>Sesia crabroniformis</i>, F.), and of two
beetles (<i>Nitidula grisea</i>, and <i>Cryptorhynchus Lapathi</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
devour the wood of the willow and sallow, which thus in
time often become so hollow as to be easily blown down.
The bee hawk-moth (<i>Sesia apiformis</i><a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>), and probably
<i>Rynchites Populi</i>, a brilliant green weevil, feeds upon the
poplar&mdash;<i>Prionus coriarius</i> is sometimes found in the oak
and sometimes in the elm, and <i>Hylurgus piniperda</i><a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>, in
the Scotch fir. Mr. Stephens informs me that the fir-trees
in a plantation of Mr. Foljambe's in Yorkshire
were destroyed by a hymenopterous insect (<i>Sirex Gigas</i>),
while those of another belonging to the same gentleman
in Wiltshire met with a similar fate from the attack of
<i>Sirex Juvencus</i>. The elm also suffers dreadfully from the
attack of another minute beetle (<i>Scolytus destructor</i>), related
to the last<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.&mdash;When the sap flows from wounds in
a tree it is attended by various other beetles, (I have observed
<i>Cetonia aurata</i>, and several <i>Nitidul√¶</i> and <i>Brachyptera</i>
busy in this way,) which prevent it from healing
so soon as it would otherwise do; and if the bark be any
where separated from the wood, a numerous army of
wood-lice, earwigs, spiders, field-bugs, and similar <i>subcortical</i>
insects take their station there and prevent a re-union.</p>

<p>The mischief however produced by any or all of these,
is not to be compared with that sometimes sustained in
Germany from the attacks of a small beetle, (<i>Bostrichus
Typographus</i>) so called on account of a fancied resemblance
between the paths it erodes and letters, which
bores into the fir. This insect, in its preparatory state,
feeds upon the soft inner bark only: but it attacks this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
important part in such vast numbers, 80,000 being sometimes
found in a single tree, that it is infinitely more
noxious than any of those that bore into the wood: and
such is its vitality, that though the bark be battered and
the tree plunged into water, or laid upon the ice or snow,
it remains alive and unhurt. The leaves of the trees
infested by these insects first become yellow, the trees
themselves then die at the top, and soon entirely perish.
Their ravages have long been known in Germany under
the name of <i>Wurm tr√∂kniss</i> (decay caused by worms); and
in the old liturgies of that country the animal itself is
formally mentioned under its vulgar appellation, "The
Turk." This pest was particularly prevalent and caused
incalculable mischief about the year 1665. In the beginning
of the last century it again showed itself in the
Hartz forests&mdash;it reappeared in 1757, redoubled its injuries
in 1769, and arrived at its height in 1783, when
the number of trees destroyed by it in the above forests
alone, was calculated at a million and a half, and the
inhabitants were threatened with a total suspension of
the working of their mines, and consequent ruin. At
this period these Bostrichi, when arrived at their perfect
state, migrated in swarms like bees into Suabia and Franconia.
At length, between the years 1784 and 1789, in
consequence of a succession of cold and moist seasons,
the numbers of this scourge were sensibly diminished.
It appeared again however in 1790, and so late as 1796
there was great reason to fear for the few fir-trees that
were left<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>The seeds of forest- as well as of fruit-trees are doubtless
subject to injuries from the same quarter, but these
being more out of the reach of observation, have not been
much noticed. Acorns, however, a considerable article
with nurserymen, are said to have both a moth and a
beetle that prey upon them; and what is remarkable,
though sometimes one larva of each is found in the same
acorn, yet two of either kind are never to be met with
together<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>. The beetle is probably the <i>Curculio Glandium</i>
(<i>Balaninus</i>) of Mr. Marsham, and is nearly related to
the species whose grub inhabits the nut.</p>

<p>Having now conducted you round and exhibited to
you the melancholy proofs of the universal dominion of
insects over our vegetable treasures, while growing or
endued with the principle of vitality, in their separate
departments,&mdash;I must next introduce you to a pest worse
than all put together, which indiscriminately attacks and
destroys every vegetable substance that the earth produces,
and which, wherever it prevails, carries famine,
pestilence and death in its train. Happily for this country&mdash;and
we cannot be too thankful for the privilege, we
know this scourge of nations only by report. The name
of <i>Locust</i>, which has been such a sound of horror in
other countries, here only suggests an object of interesting
inquiry. But the ravages of locusts are so copious
a theme that they merit to be considered in a separate
letter.</p>

<h3><i>INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>INDIRECT INJURIES CONTINUED.</h5>


<p>To look at a <i>locust</i> in a cabinet of insects, you would
not, at first sight, deem it capable of being the source of
so much evil to mankind as stands on record against it.
"This is but a small creature," you would say, "and
the mischief which it causes cannot be far beyond the
proportion of its bulk. The locusts so celebrated in
history must surely be of the Indian kind mentioned
by Pliny, which were three feet in length, with legs so
strong that the women used them as saws. I see indeed
some resemblance to the horse's head, but where are the
eyes of the elephant, the neck of the bull, the horns of
the stag, the chest of the lion, the belly of the scorpion,
the wings of the eagle, the thighs of the camel, the legs
of the ostrich, and the tail of the serpent, all of which
the Arabians mention as attributes of this widely dreaded
insect destroyer<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>; but of which in the insect before me
I discern little or no likeness?" Yet, although this animal
be not very tremendous for its size, nor very terrific
in its appearance, it is the very same whose ravages have
been the theme of naturalists and historians in all ages,
and upon a close examination you will find it to be peculiarly
fitted and furnished for the execution of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
office. It is armed with two pair of very strong jaws,
the upper terminating in short and the lower in long
teeth, by which it can both lacerate and grind its food&mdash;its
stomach is of extraordinary capacity and powers&mdash;its
hind legs enable it to leap to a considerable distance,
and its ample vans are calculated to catch the wind as
sails, and so to carry it sometimes over the sea; and although
a single individual can effect but little evil, yet
when the entire surface of a country is covered by them,
and every one makes bare the spot on which it stands,
the mischief produced may be as infinite as their numbers.
So well do the Arabians know their power, that
they make a locust say to Mahomet&mdash;"We are the
army of the Great God; we produce ninety-nine eggs;
if the hundred were completed, we should consume the
whole earth and all that is in it<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>."</p>

<p>Since it is possible you may not have paid particular
attention to the accounts given by various authors both
ancient and modern, of the almost incredible injury done
to the human race by these creatures, I shall now lay
before you some of the most striking particulars of their
devastations that I have been able to collect.</p>

<p>The earliest plague of this kind which has been recorded,
appears also to have been the most direful in
its immediate effects that ever was inflicted upon any
nation. I am speaking, as you may well suppose, of the
locusts with which the Egyptian tyrant and his people
were visited for their oppression of the Israelites. Only
conceive to yourself a country so covered by them that
no one can see the face of the ground&mdash;a whole land
darkened, and all its produce, whether herb or tree, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
devoured that not the least vestige of green is left in either<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.&mdash;But
it is not necessary for me to enlarge further
upon a history the circumstances of which are so well
known to you.</p>

<p>To this species of devastation Africa in general seems
always to have been peculiarly subject. This may be
gathered from the law in Cyrenaica mentioned by Pliny,
by which the inhabitants were enjoined to destroy the
locusts in three different states, three times in the year&mdash;first
their eggs, then their young, and lastly the perfect
insect<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>. And not without reason was such a law enacted;
for Orosius tells us that in the year of the world 3800,
Africa was infested by such infinite myriads of these
animals, that having devoured every green thing, after
flying off to sea they were drowned, and being cast upon
the shore they emitted a stench greater than could have
been produced by the carcases of 100,000 men<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>. St.
Augustine also mentions a plague to have arisen in that
country from the same cause, which destroyed no less
than 800,000 persons (<i>octingenta hominum millia</i>) in the
kingdom of Masanissa alone, and many more in the territories
bordering upon the sea<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>.</p>

<p>From Africa this plague was occasionally imported into
Italy and Spain; and a historian quoted in Mouffet relates
that in the year 591 an infinite army of locusts of a
size unusually large, grievously ravaged part of Italy;
and being at last cast into the sea, from their stench arose
a pestilence which carried off near a million of men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
beasts. In the Venetian territory, also, in 1478 more than
30,000 persons are said to have perished in a famine occasioned
by these terrific scourges. Many other instances
of their devastations in Europe, in France, Spain, Italy,
Germany, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>, are recorded by the same author. In
1650 a cloud of them was seen to enter Russia in three
different places, which from thence passed over into Poland
and Lithuania, where the air was darkened by their
numbers. In some places they were seen lying dead
heaped one upon another to the depth of four feet; in
others they covered the surface like a black cloth, the
trees bent with their weight, and the damage they did exceeded
all computation<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>. At a later period in Languedoc
when the sun became hot they took wing and fell upon
the corn, devouring both leaf and ear, and that with such
expedition that in three hours they would consume a
whole field. After having eaten up the corn they attacked
the vines, the pulse, the willows, and lastly the hemp notwithstanding
its bitterness<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>. Sir H. Davy informs us<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
that the French government in 1813 issued a decree with
a view to occasion the destruction of grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Even this happy island, so remarkably distinguished
by its exemption from most of those scourges to which
other nations are exposed, was once alarmed by the appearance
of locusts. In 1748 they were observed here in
considerable numbers, but providentially they soon perished
without propagating. These were evidently stragglers
from the vast swarms which in the preceding year
did such infinite damage in Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania,
Hungary, and Poland. One of these swarms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
which entered Transylvania in August, was several hundred
fathoms in width, (at Vienna the breadth of one of
them was three miles,) and extended to so great a length
as to be four hours in passing over the Red Tower; and
such was its density that it totally intercepted the solar
light, so that when they flew low one person could not
see another at the distance of twenty paces<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>. A similar
account has been given me by a friend of mine<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> long resident
in India. He relates that when at Poonah he was
witness to an immense army of locusts which ravaged the
Mahratta country, and was supposed to come from Arabia
(this, if correct, is a strong proof of their power to
pass the sea under favourable circumstances). The column
they composed, my friend was informed, extended
five hundred miles; and so compact was it, when on the
wing, that like an eclipse it completely hid the sun, so
that no shadow was cast by any object, and some lofty
tombs distant from his residence not more than two
hundred yards were rendered quite invisible. This was
not the <i>Locusta migratoria</i>, but a red species; which circumstance
much increased the horror of the scene; for,
clustering upon the trees after they had stripped them of
their foliage, they imparted to them a sanguine hue. The
peach was the last tree that they touched.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke, to give some idea of the infinite numbers
of these animals, compares them to a flight of snow when
the flakes are carried obliquely by the wind. They covered
his carriage and horses, and the Tartars assert that
people are sometimes suffocated by them. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
face of nature might have been described as covered by a
living veil. They consisted of two species, <i>L. tatarica</i>
and <i>migratoria</i>; the first is almost twice the size of the
second, and, because it precedes it, is called by the
Tartars the herald or messenger<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>.&mdash;The account of
another traveller, Mr. Barrow, of their ravages in the
southern parts of Africa (in 1784 and 1797) is still more
striking: an area of nearly two thousand square miles
might be said literally to be covered by them. When
driven into the sea by a N. W. wind, they formed upon
the shore for fifty miles a bank three or four feet high,
and when the wind was S. E. the stench was so powerful
as to be smelt at the distance of 150 miles<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.</p>

<p>From 1778 to 1780 the empire of Marocco was terribly
devastated by them, every green thing was eaten up, not
even the bitter bark of the orange and pomegranate escaping&mdash;a
most dreadful famine ensued.&mdash;The poor were
seen to wander over the country deriving a miserable subsistence
from the roots of plants; and women and children
followed the camels, from whose dung they picked the indigested
grains of barley, which they devoured with avidity:
in consequence of this, vast numbers perished, and
the roads and streets exhibited the unburied carcases of
the dead. On this sad occasion, fathers sold their children,
and husbands their wives<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>. When they visit a
country, says Mr. Jackson, speaking of the same empire,
it behoves every one to lay in provision for a famine, for
they stay from three to seven years. When they have
devoured all other vegetables, they attack the trees, consuming
first the leaves and then the bark. From Mogador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to Tangier, before the plague in 1799, the face of the
earth was covered by them&mdash;at that time a singular incident
occurred at El Araiche. The whole region from the
confines of the Sahara was ravaged by them: but on the
other side of the river El Kos not one of them was to be
seen, though there was nothing to prevent their flying
over it. Till then they had proceeded northward; but
upon arriving at its banks they turned to the east, so that
all the country north of El Araiche was full of pulse,
fruits and grain,&mdash;exhibiting a most striking contrast to
the desolation of the adjoining district. At length they
were all carried by a violent hurricane into the Western
Ocean; the shore, as in former instances, was covered
by their carcases, and a pestilence was caused by the
horrid stench which they emitted:&mdash;but when this evil
ceased, their devastations were followed by a most abundant
crop. The Arabs of the Desert, "whose hands are
against every man<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>," and who rejoice in the evil that
befalls other nations, when they behold the clouds of
locusts proceeding from the north are filled with gladness,
anticipating a general mortality, which they call
<i>El-Khere</i> (the benediction); for, when a country is thus
laid waste, they emerge from their arid deserts and pitch
their tents in the desolated plains<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>.</p>

<p>The noise the locusts make when engaged in the work
of destruction has been compared to the sound of a flame
of fire driven by the wind, and the effect of their bite
to that of fire<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>. A wild poet of our day has very strikingly
described the noise produced by their flight and
approach:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Onward they came a dark continuous cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of congregated myriads numberless,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The rushing of whose wings was as the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of a broad river headlong in its course<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Plunged from a mountain summit, or the roar<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But no account of the appearance and ravages of these
terrific insects, for correctness and sublimity, comes near
that of the prophet Joel, "A day of darkness and of
gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the
morning spread upon the mountains: a great people
and a strong: there hath not been ever the like, neither
shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.
A fire devoureth before them; and behind
them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden
before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness;
yea, and nothing shall escape them. Like the noise of
chariots<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like
the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble,
as a strong people set in battle array. Before their faces
the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather
blackness. They shall run like mighty men; they shall
climb the wall like men of war, and they shall march
every one on his ways, and they shall not break their
ranks; neither shall one thrust another, they shall walk
every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword
they shall not be wounded. They shall run to and fro
in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the
windows like a thief. The earth shall quake before them,
the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall
be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining!"
The usual way in which they are destroyed is also noticed
by the prophet. "I will remove far off from you
the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren
and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his
hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall
come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he
hath done great things<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>!"</p>

<p>I think, after a serious consideration of all these well
attested facts, when locusts contend with the two-legged
destroyers of the human race for proud pre-eminence in
mischief, you will find it difficult to determine to which
the palm should be decreed; and you will admire the propriety
with which, in the above and other passages of
Holy Writ, they are selected as symbols of the great
ravagers of the earth of our own species.</p>

<p>In many of the above instances these devastators appear
to have crossed the seas, but Hasselquist asserts that
they are not formed for such extensive flights. "The
grasshopper or locust," says he, "is not formed for travelling
over the sea,&mdash;it cannot fly far, but must alight
as soon as it rises;&mdash;for one that came on board us a hundred
certainly were drowned. We observe in the months
of May and June a number of these insects coming from
the south, and directing their course to the northern
shore; they darken the sky like a thick cloud; but
scarcely have they quitted the shore, when they, who a
moment before ravaged and ruined the country, cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the surface of the sea with their dead bodies.&mdash;By what
instinct do these creatures undertake this dangerous
flight? Is it not the wise institution of the Creator to
destroy a dreadful plague to the country<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>?" Locusts
however, as we have seen, take much longer flights than
this author supposes them able to do. It is probable that
their ability in this respect may depend a good deal upon
their species, their age, and the state and direction of the
wind; for, as was the case with the Egyptian plague,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"&mdash;&mdash; a pitchy cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of locusts warping on the eastern wind"<br /></span>

<p>may by a powerful blast be carried over a broad river, or
even the sea, from one country to another. This idea is
strongly confirmed by an account, exhibiting internal
marks of authenticity, which appeared in the <i>Alexandria
Herald</i>, an American newspaper; in which it is stated,
that at the distance of 200 miles from the Canary Islands,
the nearest land, the ship Georgia, Capt. Stokes, from
Lisbon to Savannah, while sailing with a fine breeze from
the south-east, was, on the 21st of Nov. 1811, all at once
becalmed. "A light air afterwards sprang up from the
north-east, at which time there fell from the cloud an innumerable
quantity of large grasshoppers, so as to cover
the deck, the tops and every part of the ship they could
alight upon. They did not appear in the least exhausted;
on the contrary, when an attempt was made to take hold
of them, they instantly jumped, and endeavoured to
elude being taken. The calm, or a very light air, lasted
fully an hour, and during the whole of the time these
insects continued to fall upon the ship and surround her:
such as were within reach of the vessel alighted upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
her; but immense numbers fell into the sea, and were
seen floating in masses by the sides." Two bottles of them
were preserved for inspection; the insects were of a reddish
hue, with red and gray speckled wings. It is clear
from this account, if it be admitted as authentic, that
locusts can go far from land when the wind is strong, and
likewise it seems equally clear that in a calm they cannot
support themselves in the air. The principal difficulty
is, how these locusts could make their way against the
wind, which they must have done if they came with the
black cloud, as the words seem to intimate. Perhaps this
cloud was brought by a different current of air from that
which impelled the ship.</p>

<p>With respect to the course which the locusts pursue,
Hasselquist has observed that they migrate in a direct
meridian line from south to north, passing from the deserts
of Arabia, which is the great cradle of them, to Palestine,
Syria, Carmania, Natolia, Bithynia, Constantinople, Poland,
&amp;c.&mdash;they never turn either to the east or to the
west<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>. But this must be a mistaken notion; for those
which Major Moor saw at Poonah, of which I have given
an account above<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>, must have come due east. Mr.
Jackson also noticed their course north of the line to be
towards the south<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>; and Sparrman tells us, that those
south of the line migrate in the same direction<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.</p>

<p>I fear that Hasselquist's question, Could they not by
fright, or some other method, be turned from their dreadful
course, to steer for some river, and by that means be
obliged to destroy themselves<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>? must be answered in the
negative. All such experiments, it is to be apprehended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
would be about as effectual as sending an army, with all
the apparatus of war, to take the field against them, as
this author says is done in Syria, where the Bashaw of
Tripoli once raised a force of 4000 soldiers to fight the
locusts, and very summarily ordered all to be hanged
who thinking it beneath them to waste their valour upon
such pygmy foes, refused to join the party<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VIII" id="LETTER_VIII">LETTER VIII.</a></h2>

<h3><i>INJURIES CAUSED BY INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>INDIRECT INJURIES CONCLUDED.</h5>


<p>I have not yet arrived at the end of my catalogue of
noxious insects. I have introduced you, indeed, to those
that annoy man in his own person, in his domestic animals,
in the produce of his fields, gardens, orchards, and
forests; in a word, in every thing that is endued with the
vital principle: but I have as yet said nothing of the injuries
which he receives from them in that part of his
property, consisting either of animal or vegetable matter,
<i>from which that principle is departed</i>. And with these I
shall conclude this melancholy detail of evils inflicted
upon us by the very animals I am enticing you to study.
The rest of my correspondence, I flatter myself, will
paint them in more inviting colours.</p>

<p>The insects to which I now allude may be divided into
those that attack and injure our food, our drugs and
medicines, our clothes, our houses and furniture, our
timber, and even the objects of our studies and amusements.</p>

<p>Various are those that attempt to share our <i>food</i> with
us. Flour and meal are eaten by the grub of <i>Tenebrio
Molitor</i>, best known by the name of the meal-worm,
which will remain in it two years before it goes into its
state of inactivity:&mdash;its ravages however are not confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
to flour alone, for it will eat any thing made of that article,
such as bread, cakes, and the like. Old flour is also
very apt to be infested by a mite (<i>Acarus Farin√¶</i>)<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>.
In long voyages the biscuit sometimes so swarms with
the weevil and another beetle (<i>Dermestes paniceus</i>, L.)
that they are swallowed with every mouthful; and even
the ground peas so abound with these little vermin, that
a spoonful of soup cannot be taken free from them<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.
Bread is also devoured by <i>Trogosita caraboides</i>, a larger
beetle before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>.</p>

<p>Every one is aware that our animal food suffers still
more than our farinaceous from insects; but perhaps you
would not expect that our hams, bacon, and dried meats
should have their peculiar beetle. Yet so it is; and this
beetle, (<i>Dermestes lardarius</i>,) when a grub, sometimes
commits great devastation in them; as does that of
another described by De Geer under the name of <i>Tenebrio
lardarius</i><a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>. How much our fresh meat of all kinds,
our poultry and fish, are exposed to the flesh-fly, whose
maggots will turn us disgusted from our tables, if we do
not carefully guard these articles from being blown by
them, you well know;&mdash;and assailants more violent, hornets,
wasps, and the great rove-beetle, (<i>Creophilus maxillosus</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
if butchers do not protect their shambles, will
carry off no inconsiderable portion of their meat. A
small cock-roach (<i>Blatta lapponica</i>) which I have taken
upon our eastern coast, swarms in the huts of the Laplanders,
and will sometimes annihilate in a single day,
a work in which a carrion-beetle (<i>Silpha lapponica</i>)
joins, their whole stock of dried fish<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>. The quantity of
sugar that flies and wasps will devour, if they can come
at it, especially the latter, the diminutive size of the creatures
considered, is astonishing:&mdash;in one year long ago,
when sugar was much cheaper than it is now, a tradesman
told me he calculated his loss, by the wasps alone,
at twenty pounds. A singular spectacle is exhibited in
India (so Captain Green relates) by a small red ant with
a black head. They march in long files, about three
abreast, to any place where sugar is kept; and when they
are saturated, return in the same order, but by a different
route. If the sugar, upon which they are busy, be
carried into the sun, they immediately desert it. What
is very extraordinary, these ants are also fond of oil.
Sweetmeats and preserves are very subject to be attacked
by a minute oblong transparent mite with very short legs
and without any hair upon its body. Our butter and
lard are stated to be eaten by the caterpillar of a moth
(<i>Aglossa pinguinalis</i>). <i>Tyrophaga</i><a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> <i>Casei</i>, the parent fly
of the jumping cheese-maggot, loses no opportunity,
we know, of laying its eggs in our fresh cheeses, and
when they get dry and old the mite (<i>Acarus Siro</i>) settles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
her colonies in them, which multiply incredibly. Other
substances, more unlikely, do not escape from our pygmy
depredators. Thus Reaumur tells us of a little moth
whose larva feeds upon chocolate, observing very justly
that this could not have been its original food<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>. Both
a moth and a beetle (<i>Sylvanus frumentarius?</i>) were detected
by Leeuwenhoek preying upon two of our spices,
the mace and the nutmeg<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>. The maggots of a fly (<i>Oscinis
cellaris</i>) are found in vinegar, in the manufactories
of which the perfect insects swarm in incredible numbers;
others I have found in wine, which turned to a
minute fly, of a yellow colour, with dark eyes and abdomen,
which though near <i>Anthomyia</i> as to its wings,
appears to belong to a distinct genus not published by
Meigen, which in my MS. stands under the name of
<i>Oinopota ventralis</i>; and sometimes even water in the
casks of ships, in long voyages, so abounds with larv√¶ of
this tribe as to render it extremely disgusting. Browne,
in his History of Jamaica, mentions an ant (<i>Formica omnivora</i>,
L.) probably belonging to <i>Myrmica</i>, that consumes
or spoils all kinds of food; which perhaps may be
the same species that has been observed in Ceylon by
Percival, and is described by him as inhabiting dwelling-houses,
and speedily devouring every thing it can meet
with. If at table any one drops a piece of bread, or of
other food, it instantly appears in motion as if animated,
from the vast number of these creatures that fasten upon
it in order to carry it off. They can be kept, he tells us,
by no contrivance from invading the table, and settling
in swarms on the bread, sugar, and such things as they
like. It is not uncommon to see a cup of tea, upon being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
poured out, completely covered with these creatures, and
floating dead upon it like a scum<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.</p>

<p>In some countries the number of flies and other insects
that enter the house in search of food, or allured
by the light, is so great as to spoil the comfort of almost
every meal. We are told that during the rainy season
in India, insects of all descriptions are so incredibly numerous,
and so busy every where, that it is often absolutely
necessary to remove the lights from the supper-table:&mdash;were
this not done, moths, flies, bugs, beetles,
and the like, would be attracted in such numbers as to
extinguish them entirely. When the lights are retained
on the table, in some places they are put into glass cylinders,
which St. Pierre tells us is the custom in the
Island of Mauritius<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>; in others the candlesticks are
placed in soup-plates, into which the insects are precipitated
and drowned. Nothing can exceed the irritation
caused by the stinking bugs when they get into the hair
or between the linen and the body; and if they be bruised
upon it the skin comes off<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>. To use the language of a
poet of the Indies, from whom some of the above facts
are selected,</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Drugs and medicines also, though often so nauseous
to us, form occasionally part of the food of insects. A
small beetle (<i>Sinodendrum pusillum</i><a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>) eats the roots of
rhubarb, in which I detected it in the East India Company's
warehouses. Opium is a dainty <i>morceau</i> to the
white ants<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>;&mdash;and, what is more extraordinary, <i>Anobium
paniceum</i><a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> (a coleopterous insect that preys naturally
upon wood) has been known to devour the blister-beetle.&mdash;Swammerdam
amongst his treasures mentions "a detestable
beetle," produced from a worm that eats the
roots of ginseng; and he likewise notices another, the
larva of which devours the bag of the musk<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.&mdash;The cochineal
at Rio de Janeiro is the prey of an insect resembling
an Ichneumon, but furnished with only two wings;
its station is in the cotton that envelops the Coccus. Previous
to its assumption of the pupa it ejects a large globule
of pure red colouring matter<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>. And lastly, the Coccus
that produces the lac (<i>C. Lacca</i>) is, we are told, devoured
by various insects<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you imagine that these universal destroyers
spare at least our garments, in which you may at first
conceive there can be nothing very tempting to excite
even the appetite of an insect. Your housekeeper, however,
would probably tell you a different story, and enlarge
upon the trouble and pains it costs her to guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
those under her care against the ravages of the moths.
Upon further inquiry you would find that nothing made
of wool, whether cloth or stuff, comes amiss to them.
There are five species described by Linn√©, which are
more or less engaged in this work: <i>Tinea vestianella</i>,
<i>tapetzella</i>, <i>pellionella</i>, <i>Recurvaria sarcitella</i>, and <i>Galleria
Mellonella</i>. Of the first we have no particular history,
except that it destroys garments in the summer; but of
the others Reaumur has given a complete one. <i>T. tapetzella</i>,
or the tapestry moth, not uncommon in our houses,
is most injurious to the lining of carriages, which are
more exposed to the air than the furniture of our apartments.
These do not construct a moveable habitation
like the common species, but, eating their way in the
thickness of the cloth, weave themselves silken galleries
in which they reside, and which they render close and
warm by covering them with some of the eroded wool<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>.
<i>T. pellionella</i> is a most destructive insect, and ladies have
often to deplore the ravages which it commits in their
valuable furs, whether made up into muffs or tippets&mdash;it
pays no more respect to the regal ermine than to the
woollen habiliments of the poor; its proper food, indeed,
being hair, though it devours both wool and fur. This
species, if hard pressed by hunger, will even eat horsehair,
and make its habitation, a moveable house or case,
in which it travels from place to place, of this untractable
material. These little creatures will shave the hair from
a skin as neatly and closely as if a razor had been employed<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.&mdash;The
most natural food of the next species,
<i>R. sarcitella</i>, is wool; but in case of necessity it will eat
fur and hair. To woollen cloths or stuffs it often does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
incredible injury, especially if they are not kept dry and
well aired<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>. Of the devastation committed by <i>Galleria
Mellonella</i> in our bee-hives I have before given you an
account: to this I must here add, that if it cannot come
at wax, it will content itself with woollen cloth, leather,
or even paper<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>. Mr. Curtis found the grub of a beetle
(<i>Ptinus Fur</i>) in an old coat, which it devoured, making
holes and channels in it; and another insect of the same
order (<i>Megatoma Pellio</i>), Linn√© tells us, will sometimes
entirely strip a fur garment of its hair<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>. A small beetle
of the Capricorn tribe (<i>Callidium pygm√¶um</i>) I have good
reason to believe devours leather, since I have found it
abundant in old shoes.</p>

<p>Next to our garments our houses and buildings, which
shelter us and our property from the inclemency and injuries
of the atmosphere, are of consequence to us: yet
these, solid and substantial as they appear, are not secure
from the attack of insects; and even our furniture
often suffers from them. A great part of our comfort
within doors depends upon our apartments being kept
clean and neat. Spiders by their webs, which they suspend
in every angle, and flies by their excrements, which
they scatter indiscriminately upon every thing, interfere
with this comfort, and add much to the business of our
servants. Even ants will sometimes plant their colonies
in our kitchens, (I have known the horse-ant, <i>Formica
rufa</i>, do this,) and are not easily expelled. Those of Sierra
Leone, as I was once informed by the learned Professor
Afzelius, make their way by millions through the houses.
They resolutely pursue a straight course; and neither
buildings nor rivers, even though myriads perish in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
attempt, can divert them from it. Numerous are the
tribes of insects that seek their food in our timber,
whether laid up in store for our future use, employed in
our houses, buildings, gates or fences, or made up into
furniture. The several species of Mr. Marsham's genus
<i>Ips</i> (which includes the coleopterous genera <i>Apate</i>,
<i>Bostrichus</i>, <i>Hylessinus</i>, <i>Hylurgus</i>, <i>Tomicus</i>, <i>Platypus</i>,
<i>Scolytus</i>, and <i>Phloiotribus</i> of modern systematists) all
prey upon timber, feeding between the bark and the
wood, and many of them excavating curious pinnated
labyrinths. Almost every kind of tree has a species of
this genus appropriated to it, and some have more than
one<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>. The Stag-beetle tribe, or <i>Lucanid√¶</i>, and several
of the weevils<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>, have a similar appetite, but penetrate
deeper into the wood. The most extensive family, however,
of timber-borers are the capricorn beetles, including
the Fabrician genera of <i>Prionus</i>, <i>Cerambyx</i>, <i>Lamia</i><a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>,
<i>Stenocorus</i>, <i>Calopus</i>, <i>Rhagium</i>, <i>Gnoma</i>, <i>Saperda</i>, <i>Callidium</i>,
and <i>Clytus</i>. The larva of these, as soon as hatched,
leaves its first station between the bark and wood, and
begins to make its way into the solid timber, (some of
them plunging even into the iron heart of the oak, and
one even perforating lead<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>,) where it eats for itself tortuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
paths, at its first starting perhaps not bigger than a
pin's head, but gradually increasing in dimensions as the
animal increases in magnitude, till it attains in some instances
to a diameter of one or two inches. Only conceive
what havoc the grub of the vast <i>Prionus giganteus</i>
must make in a beam! Percival is probably speaking
of this beetle, when, in his account of Ceylon, he tells
us, "There is an insect found here which resembles an
immense over-grown beetle. It is called by us a carpenter,
from its boring large holes in timber, of a regular
form, and to the depth of several feet, in which,
when finished, it takes up its habitation<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>." Seeing the
perfect insect come out of these holes, an unentomological
observer would naturally conclude that the beetle
he saw had formed it, and lived in it; but, doubtless,
the whole was the work of the grub<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>.&mdash;Of all the coleopterous
genera there is none the species of which are
generally so rich, resplendent and beautiful as those of
<i>Buprestis</i>: these likewise, in their first state, there is
abundant reason to believe, derive their nutriment from
the produce of the forest, in which they sometimes remain
for many years before they assume their perfect
state, and appear in their full splendour, as if nature
required more time than usual to decorate these lovely
insects. We learn from Mr. Marsham, that the grub of
<i>B. splendida</i> was ascertained to have existed in the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of a deal table more than twenty years<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>.&mdash;In this enumeration
of timber-eating beetles, I must not forget the
Fabrician genera, <i>Anobium</i> and <i>Ptilinus</i>, because of one
of them (<i>Anobium pertinax</i>) Linn√© complains "<i>terebravit
et destruxit sedilia mea</i><a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>;" and I can renew the
same complaint against <i>A. striatum</i>, which not only has
destroyed my chairs, but also picture-frames, and has
perforated in every direction the deal floor of my chamber,
from which it annually emerges through little round
apertures in great numbers.&mdash;The utility of entomological
knowledge in economics was strikingly exemplified,
when the great naturalist just mentioned, at the desire
of the king of Sweden, traced out the cause of the destruction
of the oak-timber in the royal dock-yards; and,
having detected the lurking culprit under the form of a
beetle, (<i>Lymexylon navale</i>) by directing the timber to be
immersed during the time of the metamorphosis of that
insect and its season of oviposition, furnished a remedy
which effectually secured it from its future attacks<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>.&mdash;No
coleopterous insects are more singular than those
that belong to the genus <i>Pausus</i>, L.; and one of them at
least, remarkable for emitting a phosphoric light from
the globes of its antenn√¶, is also a timber-feeder<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>.&mdash;Amongst
the <i>Hymenoptera</i> there are many insects that
injure us in this department. The species of the genus
<i>Sirex</i>, probably all of them in their <i>larva</i> state, have no
appetite but for ligneous food. Linn√© has observed this
with respect to <i>S. Spectrum</i> and <i>Camelus</i>; and Mr. Marsham,
on the authority of Sir Joseph Banks, relates that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
several specimens of <i>S. Gigas</i> were seen to come out of

small alarm and discomfiture of both nurse and children<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.&mdash;The

Parietum</i>, Latreille's genera <i>Xylocopa</i>, <i>Chelostoma</i>,
<i>Heriades</i>, <i>Megachile</i> and <i>Anthophora</i>, (all separated from

form cells for their young<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>.</p>

<p>The Linnean order <i>Aptera</i> furnishes another timber-eating
insect, a kind of wood-louse, though scarcely an
eighth of the size of the common one, (<i>Limnoria terebrans</i>
of Dr. Leach,) which in point of rapidity of execution
seems to surpass all its European brethren, and
in many cases may be productive of more serious injury
than any of them, since it attacks the wood-work of piers
and jetties constructed in salt-water, and so effectually,
as to threaten the rapid destruction of those in which it
has established itself. In December 1815 I was favoured
by Charles Lutwidge, esq. of Hull, with specimens
of wood from the piers at Bridlington Quay which
wofully confirm the fears entertained of their total ruin
by the hosts of these pygmy assailants that have made
good a lodgement in them, and which, though not so
big as a grain of rice, ply their masticatory organs with
such assiduity as to have reduced great part of the wood-work
into a state resembling honey-comb. One specimen
was a portion of a three-inch fir plank nailed to
the North Pier about three years since, which is now
crumbled away to less than an inch in thickness&mdash;in fact,
deducting the space occupied by the cells which cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
both surfaces as closely as possible, barely half an inch
of solid wood is left; and though its progress is slower
in oak, that wood is equally liable to be attacked by it.&mdash;If
this insect were easily introduced to new stations,
it might soon prove as destructive to our jetties as the
<i>Teredo navalis</i> to those of Holland, and induce the necessity
of substituting stone for wood universally, whatever
the expense: but happily it seems endowed with
very limited powers of migration; for, though it has
spread along both the South and East Piers of Bridlington
harbour, it has not yet, as Mr. Lutwidge informs
me, reached the dolphin nor an insulated jetty within
the harbour.&mdash;No other remedy against its attacks is
known than that of keeping the wood free from salt-water
for three or four days, in which case it dies; but
this method it is obvious can be rarely applicable<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.</p>

<p>How dear are their books, their cabinets of the various
productions of nature, and their collections of
prints and other works of art and science, to the learned,
the scientific, and the virtuosi! Even these precious
treasures have their insect enemies. The larva of <i>Aglossa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
pinguinalis</i>, whose ravages in another quarter I have
noticed before<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>, will establish itself upon the binding of
a book, and spinning a robe, which it covers with its
own excrement<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>, will do it no little injury. A mite
(<i>Cheyletus eruditus</i>) eats the paste that fastens the paper
over the edges of the binding, and so loosens it<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>. I
have also often observed the caterpillar of another little
moth, of which I have not ascertained the species, that
takes its station in damp old books, between the leaves,
and there commits great ravages; and many a black-letter
rarity, which in these days of Bibliomania would
have been valued at its weight in gold, has been snatched
by these destroyers from the hands of book-collectors.
The little wood-boring beetles before mentioned (<i>Anobium
pertinax</i> and <i>striatum</i>) also attack books, and will
even bore through several volumes. M. Peignot mentions
an instance where, in a public library but little frequented,
<i>twenty-seven</i> folio volumes were perforated in
a straight line by the same insect, (probably one of
these species,) in such a manner that on passing a cord
through the perfectly round hole made by it, these
twenty-seven volumes could be raised at once<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>. The
animals last mentioned also destroy prints and drawings,
whether framed, or preserved in a porte-feuille. Our
collections of quadrupeds, birds, insects and plants have
likewise several terrible insect enemies, which without
pity or remorse often destroy or mutilate our most highly
prized specimens. <i>Ptinus Fur</i> and <i>Anthrenus Mus√¶orum</i>,
two minute beetles, are amongst the worst, especially the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
latter, whose singular gliding larva, when once it gets
amongst them, makes astonishing havoc, the birds soon
shedding their feathers, and the insects falling to pieces.
Mr. W. S. MacLeay informs me that at the Havana it is
exceedingly difficult to preserve insects, &amp;c., as the <i>ants</i>
devour every thing.&mdash;One of the worst plagues of the
entomologist is a mite (<i>Acarus Destructor</i>, Schrank):
this, if his specimens be at all damp, eats up all the
muscular parts, (<i>Cantharis vesicatoria</i> being almost the
only insect that is not to its taste,) and thus entirely
destroys them.&mdash;If spiders by any means get amongst
them, they will do no little mischief.&mdash;Some I have observed
to be devoured by a minute moth, perhaps <i>Tinea
Insectella</i>; and in the posterior thighs of a species of
<i>Locusta</i> from China, I once found, one in each thigh, a
small beetle congenerous with <i>Antherophagus pallens</i>,
that had devoured the interior. It is, I believe, either
<i>Acarus Destructor</i> or <i>Cheyletus eruditus</i> that eats the gum
employed to fasten down dried plants.</p>

<p>There are other insects which do not confine themselves
to one or two articles, but make a general and
indiscriminate attack upon our dead stock. Ulloa mentions
one peculiar to Carthagena, called there the <i>comegen</i>,
which he describes as a kind of moth or maggot so
minute as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>. This
destroys, says he, the furniture of houses, particularly
all kinds of hangings, whether of cloth, linen, or silk,
gold or silver stuffs or lace; in short, every thing except
solid metal. It will in a single night ruin all the goods
of a warehouse in which it has got footing, reducing bales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of merchandize to dust without altering their appearance,
so that the mischief is not perceived till they come to be
handled<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>. If we make some deduction from this account
for exaggeration, still the amount of damage will be very
considerable.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of insects better known, to
whose ravages, as most prominent and celebrated, I
shall last call your attention. The insects I mean are
the cock-roach (<i>Blatta orientalis</i>), the house-cricket
(<i>Gryllus domesticus</i>), and the various species of white
ants (<i>Termes</i>). The last of these, most fortunately for
us, are not yet naturalized.</p>

<p>The cock-roaches hate the light, at least the kind that
is most abundant in Britain, (for <i>B. germanica</i>, which
abounds in some houses, is bolder, making its appearance
in the day, and running up the walls and over the
tables, to the great annoyance of the inhabitants,) and
never come forth from their hiding-places till the lights
are removed or extinguished. In the London houses,
especially on the ground-floor, they are most abundant,
and consume every thing they can find, flour, bread,
meat, clothes, and even shoes<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>. As soon as light, natural
or artificial, re-appears, they all scamper off as fast
as they can, and vanish in an instant. These pests are
not indigenous here, and perhaps no where in Europe,
but are one of the evils which commerce has imported:
and we may think ourselves well off that others of the
larger species of the genus have not been introduced
in the same way&mdash;as, for instance, <i>Blatta gigantea</i>, a
native of Asia, Africa, and America, many times the size
of the common one,&mdash;which, not content with devouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
meat, clothes and books, even attacks persons in their
sleep, and the extremities of the dead and dying<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>.</p>

<p>The house-cricket may perhaps be deemed a still more
annoying insect than the common cock-roach, adding
an incessant noise to its ravages; since, although, for a
short time, it may not be unpleasant to hear</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"the cricket chirrup in the hearth,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so constant a din every evening must very much interrupt
comfort and conversation. These garrulous animals,
which live in a kind of artificial torrid zone, are very
thirsty souls, and are frequently found drowned in pans
of water, milk, broth, and the like. Whatever is moist,
even stockings or linen hung out to dry, is to them a
<i>bonne bouche</i>; they will eat the scummings of pots, yeast,
crumbs of bread, and even salt, or any thing within
their reach. Sometimes they are so abundant in houses
as to become absolute pests, flying into the candles and
into people's faces.</p>

<p>At Cuddapa, in the ceded districts to the northward
of Mysore, Captain Green was much annoyed by a
jumping insect, which from his description I should take
for the larva of a species of cricket. They were of a dun
colour, and from half to three-fourths of an inch in
length. They abounded at night, and were very injurious
to papers and books, which they both discoloured
and devoured; leather also was eaten by them. Such
was their boldness and avidity, that they attacked the
exposed parts of the body when you were asleep, nibbling
the ends of the fingers, particularly the skin under
the nails, which was only discoverable by a slight soreness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
that succeeded. So great was their agility that
they could seldom be caught or crushed. They were a
mute insect, but probably the imago would make noise
enough.</p>

<p>But the <i>white ants</i>, wherever they prevail, are a still
worse plague than either of these insects&mdash;they are the
great calamity, as Linn√© terms them, of both the Indies.
When they find their way into houses or warehouses,
nothing less hard than metal or glass escapes their
ravages. Their favourite food, however, is wood of all
kinds, except the teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i>) and iron-wood
(<i>Sideroxylon</i>), which are the only sorts known that they
will not touch<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>; and so infinite are the multitudes of
the assailants, and such is the excellence of their tools,
that all the timber-work of a spacious apartment is often
destroyed by them in a few nights. Exteriorly, however,
every thing appears as if untouched; for these wary
depredators, and this is what constitutes the greatest
singularity of their history, carry on all their operations
by sap and mine, destroying first the inside of solid substances,
and scarcely ever attacking their outside, until
first they have concealed it and their operations with a
coat of clay. A general similarity runs through the proceedings
of the whole tribe; but the large African species,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
(called by Smeathman <i>Termes bellicosus</i>,) <i>T. fatalis</i>
is the most formidable. These insects live in large clay
nests, from whence they excavate tunnels all round,
often to the extent of several hundred feet; from these
they will descend a considerable depth below the foundation
of a house, and rise again through the floors; or,
boring through the posts and supports of the building,
enter the roof, and construct there their galleries in
various directions. If a post be a convenient path to the
roof, or has any weight to support, which how they discover
is not easily conjectured, they will fill it with their
mortar, leaving only a trackway for themselves; and
thus, as it were, convert it from wood into stone as
hard as many kinds of free-stone. In this manner they
soon destroy houses, and sometimes even whole villages
when deserted by their inhabitants, so that in two or
three years not a vestige of them will remain.</p>

<p>These insidious insects are not less expeditious in
destroying the wainscoting, shelves, and other fixtures
of a house than the house itself. With the most consummate
art and skill they eat away all the inside of what
they attack, except a few fibres here and there which
exactly suffice to keep the two sides, or top and bottom,
connected, so as to retain the appearance of solidity after
the reality is gone; and all the while they carefully avoid
perforating the surface, unless a book or any other thing
that tempts them should be standing upon it. K√¶mpfer,
speaking of the white ants of Japan, gives a remarkable
instance of the rapidity with which these miners
proceed. Upon rising one morning he observed that
one of their galleries of the thickness of his little finger
had been formed across his table; and, upon a further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
examination, he found that they had bored a passage of
that thickness up one foot of the table, formed a gallery
across it, and then pierced down another foot into the
floor: all this was done in the few hours that intervened
between his retiring to rest and his rising<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>. They make
their way also with the greatest ease into trunks and
boxes, even though made of mahogany, and destroy
papers and every thing they contain, constructing their
galleries and sometimes taking up their abode in them.
Hence, as Humboldt informs us, throughout all the
warmer parts of equinoctial America, where these and
other destructive insects abound, it is infinitely rare to
find papers which go fifty or sixty years back<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>. In one
night they will devour all the boots and shoes that are
left in their way; cloth, linen, or books are equally to
their taste; but they will not eat cotton, as Captain Green
informs me. I myself have to deplore that they entirely
consumed a collection of insects made for me by a friend
in India, more especially as it sickened him of the employment.
In a word, scarcely any thing, as I said
before, but metal or stone comes amiss to them. Mr.
Smeathman relates, that a party of them once took a
fancy to a pipe of fine old Madeira, not for the sake of
the wine, almost the whole of which they let out, but of
the staves, which however I suppose were strongly imbued
with it, and perhaps on that account were not less
to the taste of our epicure Termites. Having left a
compound microscope in a warehouse at Tobago for a
few months, on his return he found that a colony of a
small species of white ant had established themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
it, and had devoured most of the wood-work, leaving
little besides the metal and glasses<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>. A shorter period
sufficed for their demolition of some of Mr. Forbes's
furniture. On surveying a room which had been locked
up during an absence of a few weeks, he observed a
number of advanced works in various directions towards
some prints and drawings in English frames; the glasses
appeared to be uncommonly dull, and the frames covered
with dust. "On attempting," says he, "to wipe it off,
I was astonished to find the glasses fixed to the wall,
not suspended in frames as I left them, but completely
surrounded by an incrustation cemented by the white
ants, who had actually eaten up the deal frames and
back-boards, and the greater part of the paper, and left
the glasses upheld by the incrustation, or covered way,
which they had formed during their depredation<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>." It
is even asserted that the superb residence of the Governor-General
at Calcutta, which cost the East India
Company such immense sums, is now rapidly going to
decay in consequence of the attacks of these insects<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>.&mdash;But
not content with the dominions they have acquired,
and the cities they have laid low on Terra Firma, encouraged
by success the white ants have also aimed at
the sovereignty of the ocean, and once had the hardihood
to attack even a British ship of the line; and, in
spite of the efforts of her commander and his valiant
crew, having boarded they got possession of her, and
handled her so roughly, that when brought into port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
being no longer fit for service, she was obliged to be
broken up<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.</p>

<p>And here, I think, I see you throw aside my papers,
and hear you exclaim&mdash;"Will this enumeration of
scourges, plagues, and torments never be finished? Was
the whole insect race created merely with punitive views,
and to mar the fair face of universal nature? Are they all,
as our Saviour said figuratively of one genus, the scorpion,
the powerful agents and instruments of the great
enemy of mankind<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>?" If you view the subject in another
light, you will soon, my friend, be convinced that,
instead of this, insects generally answer the most beneficial
ends, and promote in various ways, and in an extraordinary
degree, the welfare of man and animals; and
that the series of evils I have been engaged in enumerating
mostly occur partially, and where they exceed
their natural limits; God permitting this occasionally to
take place, not merely with punitive views, but also to
show us what mighty effects he can produce by instruments
seemingly the most insignificant: thus calling
upon us to glorify his power, wisdom, and goodness, so
evidently manifested whether he relaxes or draws tight
the reins by which he guides insects in their course, and
regulates their progress; and more particularly to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
his overruling Providence so conspicuously
exhibited by his measuring them, as it were, and weighing
them, and telling them out, so that, their numbers,
forces and powers being annually proportioned to the
work he has prescribed to them, they may neither exceed
his purpose nor fall short of it.</p>

<p>From the picture I have drawn, and I assure you it
is not overcharged, you will be disposed to admit, however,
the empire of insects over the works of creation,
and to own that our prosperity, comfort and happiness
are intimately connected with them; and consequently
that the knowledge and study of them may be extremely
useful and necessary to promote these desirable ends,
since the knowledge of the cause of any evil is always
a principal, if not an indispensable, step towards a remedy.</p>

<p>I shall now bid adieu to this unpromising subject,
which has so long occupied my pen, and I fear wearied
your attention, and in my next bring before you a more
agreeable scene, in which you will behold the <i>benefits</i> we
receive by the ministry of insects.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_IX" id="LETTER_IX">LETTER IX.</a></h2>

<h3><i>BENEFITS DERIVED FROM INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>INDIRECT BENEFITS.</h5>


<p>My last letters contained, I must own, a most melancholy
though not an overcharged picture of the injuries
and devastation which man, in various ways, experiences
through the instrumentality of the insect world. In this
and the following I hope to place before you a more
agreeable scene, since in them I shall endeavour to point
out in what respects these minute animals are made to
benefit us, and what advantages we reap from their extensive
agency.</p>

<p>God, in all the evil which he permits to take place,
whether spiritual, moral, or natural, has the ultimate good
of his creatures in view. The evil that we suffer is often
a countercheck which restrains us from greater evil, or a
spur to stimulate us to good: we should therefore consider
every thing, not according to the present sensations
of pain, or the present loss or injury that it occasions, but
according to its more general, remote, and permanent
effects and bearings;&mdash;whether by it we are not impelled
to the practice of many virtues which otherwise might
lie dormant in us&mdash;whether our moral habits are not improved&mdash;whether
we are not rendered by it more prudent,
cautious, and wary, more watchful to prevent evil,
more ingenious and skilful to remedy it&mdash;and whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
our higher faculties are not brought more into play, and
our mental powers more invigorated, by the meditation
and experiments necessary to secure ourselves. Viewed
in these lights, what was at first regarded as wholly made
up of evil, may be discovered to contain a considerable
proportion of good.</p>

<p>This reasoning is here particularly applicable: and if
the ultimate benefit to man seems in any case problematical,
it is merely because to discover it requires more
extended and remote views than we are enabled by our
limited faculties to take, and a knowledge of distant or
concealed results which we are incompetent to calculate
or discover. The common good of this terraqueous globe
requires that all things endowed with vegetable or animal
life should bear certain proportions to each other; and if
any individual species exceeds that proportion, from beneficial
it becomes noxious, and interferes with the general
welfare. It was requisite therefore for the benefit of the
whole system that certain means should be provided, by
which this hurtful luxuriance might be checked, and all
things taught to keep within their proper limits: hence
it became necessary that some should prey upon others,
and a part be sacrificed for the good of the whole.</p>

<p>Of the counterchecks thus provided, none act a more
important part than insects, particularly in the vegetable
kingdom, every plant having its insect enemies. Man,
when he takes any plant from its natural state and makes
it an object of cultivation, must expect that these agents
will follow it into the artificial state in which he has placed
it, and still prey upon it; and it is his business to exert
his faculties in inventing means to guard against their attacks.
It is a wise provision that there should exist a race
of beings empowered to remove all her superfluous productions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
from the face of nature; and in effecting this,
whatever individual injury may arise, insects must be
deemed general benefactors. Even the locusts which lay
waste whole countries clear the way for the renovation
of their vegetable productions, which were in danger of
being destroyed by the exuberance of some individual
species, and thus are fulfilling the great law of the Creator,
that of all which he has made nothing should be lost.
A region, Sparrman tells us, which had been choked
up by shrubs, perennial plants, and hard half-withered
and unpalatable grasses, after being made bare by these
scourges, soon appears in a far more beautiful dress,
clothed with new herbs, superb lilies, and fresh annual
grasses, and young and juicy shoots of the perennial kinds,
affording delicious herbage for the wild cattle and game<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.
And though the interest of individual man is often sacrificed
to the general good, in many cases the insect pests
which he most execrates will be found to be positively
beneficial to him, unless when suffered to increase beyond
their due bounds. Thus the insects that attack the roots
of the grasses, and, as has been before observed, so materially
injure our herbage, the wire-worm, the larv√¶ of
<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>, <i>Tipula oleracea</i>, &amp;c., in ordinary
seasons only devour so much as is necessary to make
room for fresh shoots, and the production of new herbage;
in this manner maintaining a constant succession of young
plants, and causing an annual though partial renovation
of our meadows and pastures. In the rich fields near Rye
in Sussex I particularly observed this effect; and I have
since at home remarked, that at certain times of the year
dead plants may be every where observed, pulled up by the
cattle as they feed, whose place is supplied by new offsets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
So that, when in moderate numbers, these insects do no
more harm to the grass than would the sharp-toothed
harrows which it has been sometimes advised to apply
to hide-bound pastures, and the beneficial operation of
which in loosening the sub-soil these insect-borers closely
imitate.</p>

<p>Nor would it be difficult to show that the ordinary good
effects of some of those insects, which torment ourselves
and our cattle, preponderate over their evil ones. Mr.
Clark is inclined to think that the gentle irritation of
<i>Gasterophilus Equi</i> is advantageous to the stomach of the
horse rather than the contrary. On the same principle
it is not improbable that the Tabani often act as useful
phlebotomists to our full-fed animals; and that the constant
motion in which they are kept in summer by the
attacks of the Stomoxys and other flies, may prevent diseases
that would be brought on by indolence and repletion.
And in the case of man himself, if I do not go so
far as with Linn√© to give the louse the credit of preserving
full-fed boys from coughs, epilepsy, &amp;c., we may
safely regard as no small good, the stimulus which
these, and others of the insect assailants of the persons
of the dirty and the vicious, afford to personal cleanliness
and purity.</p>

<p>I might enlarge greatly upon the foregoing view of the
subject: but this is unnecessary, as numerous facts will
occur in subsequent letters which you will readily perceive
have an intimate bearing upon it; and I shall therefore
proceed to point out the more evident benefits
which we derive from insects, arranging them under the
two great heads of <i>direct</i> benefits, and those which are
<i>indirect</i>; beginning with the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>The insects which are <i>indirectly</i> beneficial to us, may
be considered under three points of view: First, as removing
various nuisances and deformities from the face
of nature: Secondly, as destroying other insects, that but
for their agency would multiply so as greatly to injure
and annoy us: and Thirdly, as supplying food to useful
animals, particularly to fish and birds.</p>

<p>To advert in the <i>first</i> place to the former. All substances
must be regarded as nuisances and deformities,
when considered with relation to the whole, which are
deprived of the principle of animation. In this relation
stand a dead carcase, a dead tree, or a mass of excrement,
which are clearly incumbrances that it is desirable
to have removed; and the office of effecting this removal
is chiefly assigned to insects, which have been justly
called the great scavengers of nature. Let us consider
their little but effective operations in each of their vocations.</p>

<p>How disgusting to the eye, how offensive to the smell,
would be the whole face of nature, were the vast quantity
of <i>excrement</i> daily falling to the earth from the various
animals which inhabit it, suffered to remain until gradually
dissolved by the rain or decomposed by the elements!
That it does not thus offend us, we are indebted
to an inconceivable host of insects which attack it the
moment it falls; some immediately beginning to devour
it, others depositing in it eggs from which are soon hatched
larv√¶ that concur in the same office with tenfold voracity:
and thus every particle of dung, at least of the
most offensive kinds, speedily swarms with inhabitants
which consume all the liquid and noisome particles, leaving
nothing but the undigested remains, that soon dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and are scattered by the winds, while the grass upon
which it rested, no longer smothered by an impenetrable
mass, springs up with increased vigour.</p>

<p>Numerous are the tribes of insects to which this office
is assigned, though chiefly if not entirely selected from
the two orders <i>Coleoptera</i> and <i>Diptera</i>. A large proportion
of the genera formed, by different authors, from
Scarab√¶us of Linn√©, viz. <i>Scarab√¶us</i>, <i>Copris</i>, <i>Ateuchus</i>,
<i>Sisyphus</i>, <i>Onitis</i>, <i>Onthophagus</i>, <i>Aphodius</i>, and <i>Psammodius</i>;
also <i>Hister</i>, <i>Sph√¶ridium</i>; and amongst the <i>Brachyptera</i>,
the majority of the <i>Staphylinid√¶</i>, many <i>Aleochar√¶</i>,
especially of Gravenhorst's third family, many
<i>Oxyteli</i> and some <i>Omalia</i>, <i>Tachini</i> and <i>Tachypori</i>, of that
author, including in the whole many hundred species of
beetles&mdash;unite their labours to effect this useful purpose:
and what is remarkable, though they all work their way
in these filthy masses, and at first can have no paths, yet
their bodies are never soiled by the ordure they inhabit.
Many of these insects content themselves with burrowing
in the dung alone; but <i>Ateuchus pilularius</i><a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>, a species
called in America the <i>Tumble-dung</i>, whose singular man&#339;uvres
I shall subsequently have to advert to, <i>Copris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
lunaris</i>, <i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i> and many other lamellicorn
beetles, make large cylindrical holes, often of great
depth, under the heap, and there deposit their eggs surrounded
by a mass of dung in which they have previously
enveloped them; thus not only dispersing the dung,
but actually burying it at the roots of the adjoining
plants, and by these means contributing considerably to
the fertility of our pastures, supplying the constant
waste by an annual conveyance of fresh dung laid at
the very root; by these canals, also, affording a convenient
passage for a portion of it when dissolved to be
carried thither by the rain.</p>

<p>The coleopterous insects found in dung inhabit it in
their perfect as well as imperfect states: but this is not
the case with those of the order <i>Diptera</i>, whose larv√¶
alone find their nutriment in it; the imago, which would
be suffocated did it attempt to burrow into a material so
soft, only laying its eggs in the mass. These also are
more select in their choice than the <i>Coleoptera</i>&mdash;not indeed
as to delicacy,&mdash;but they do not indiscriminately
oviposit in all kinds, some preferring horse-dung, others
swine's-dung, others cow-dung, which seems the most
favourite pabulum of all the dung-loving insects, and
others that of birds. The most disgusting of all is the
rat-tailed larva that inhabits our privies, which changes
to a fly (<i>Eristalis tenax</i>) somewhat resembling a bee.</p>

<p>Still more would our olfactory nerves be offended, and
our health liable to fatal injuries, if the wisdom and goodness
of Providence had not provided for the removal of
another nuisance from our globe&mdash;the <i>dead carcases</i> of
animals. When these begin to grow putrid, every one
knows what dreadful miasmata exhale from them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
taint the air we breathe. But no sooner does life depart
from the body of any creature, at least of any which from
its size is likely to become a nuisance, than myriads of
different sorts of insects attack it, and in various ways.
First come the Histers and pierce the skin. Next follow
the flesh-flies, some, that no time may be lost, (as <i>Sarcophaga
carnaria</i>, &amp;c.) depositing upon it their young already
hatched<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>; others (<i>Musca C√¶sar</i>, &amp;c.) covering it
with millions of eggs, whence in a day or two proceed
innumerable devourers. An idea of the dispatch made
by these gourmands may be gained from the combined
consideration of their numbers, voracity and rapid development.
One female of <i>S. carnaria</i> will give birth to
20,000 young; and the larv√¶ of many flesh-flies, as Redi
ascertained, will in twenty-four hours devour so much
food, and grow so quickly, as to increase their weight
two hundred fold! In five days after being hatched they
arrive at their full growth and size, which is a remarkable
instance of the care of Providence in fitting them for
the part they are destined to act: for if a longer time
was required for their growth, their food would not be
a fit aliment for them, or they would be too long in
removing the nuisance it is given in charge to them to
dissipate. Thus we see there was some ground for Linn√©'s
assertion under <i>M. vomitoria</i>, that three of these flies will
devour a dead horse as quickly as would a lion.</p>

<p>As soon as the various tribes of <i>Muscid√¶</i> have opened
the way, and devoured the softer parts, a whole host of
beetles, <i>Necrophori</i>, <i>Silph√¶</i>, <i>Dermestes</i>, <i>Cholev√¶</i>, and <i>Staphylinid√¶</i>,
actively second their labours. Wasps and
hornets also come in for their portion of the spoil; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
even ants, which prowl every where, rival their giant competitors
in the quantity consumed by them; so that in no
very long time, especially in warm climates, the muscular
covering is removed from the skeleton, which is then
cleansed from all remains of it by the little <i>Corynetes c√¶ruleus</i>
and <i>ruficollis</i>, (which last is so interesting, as having
been the means of saving the life of Latreille<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>,) and
several <i>Nitidul√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>. Even the horns of animals have an
appropriate genus (<i>Trox</i>) which inhabits them, and feeds
upon their contents. And not only are large animals
thus disposed of, even the smallest are not suffered long
to annoy us. The burying beetle (<i>Necrophorus Vespillo</i>)
inters the bodies of small animals, such as mice, several
assisting each other in the work; and those to which
they commit their eggs afford an ample supply of food to
their larv√¶<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>. Ants also in some degree emulate these
burying insects, at least they will carry off the carcases
of insects into their nests; and I once saw some of the
horse-ants dragging away a half-dead snake of about the
size of a goose-quill<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>. Some insects will even attack
living animals and make them their prey, thus contributing
to keep them within due limits. The common
earth-worm is attacked and devoured by a centipede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
(<i>Geophilus electricus</i>). Mr. Sheppard saw one attack a
worm ten times its own size, round which it twisted itself
like a serpent, and which it finally mastered and
devoured.</p>

<p>But insects are not only useful in removing and dissipating
dead animal matter; they are also intrusted with
a similar office with respect to the <i>vegetable</i> kingdom.
The interior of rotten trees is inhabited by the larv√¶ of a
particular kind of crane-fly with pectinated antenn√¶
(<i>Ctenophora</i><a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>), and other insects, which there find an
appropriate nutriment; and a similar diet is furnished to
the grubs of the rose-beetle (<i>Cetonia aurata</i>) by the dead
leaves and stalks usually to be found in an ant's nest.
<i>Staphylinid√¶</i>, <i>Sph√¶ridia</i>, and other <i>Coleoptera</i>, are always
found under heaps of putrescent vegetables; and an infinite
number are to be met with in decomposing fungi,
which seem to be a kind of substance intermediate between
animal and vegetable. The Boleti in particular have
a genus of coleopterous insects appropriated to them<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>,
and the Lycoperdons another.&mdash;Stagnant waters, which
would otherwise exhale putrid miasmata and be often the
cause of fatal disorders, are purified by the innumerable
larv√¶ of gnats, Ephemer√¶, and other insects which live
in them and abstract from them all the unwholesome part
of their contents. This, Linn√© says, will easily appear
if any one will make the experiment by filling two vessels
with putrid water, leaving the larv√¶ in one and taking
them out of the other. For then he will soon find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
water that is full of larv√¶ pure and without any stench,
while that which is deprived of them will continue stinking<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>.</p>

<p>Benefits equally great are rendered by the wood-destroying
insects. We indeed, in this country, who find
use for ten times more timber than we produce, could
dispense with their services; but to estimate them at their
proper value, as affecting the great system of nature,
we should transport ourselves to tropical climes, or to
those under the temperate zones, where millions of acres
are covered by one interminable forest. How is it that
these untrodden regions, where thousands of their giant
inhabitants fall victims to the slow ravages of time, or the
more sudden operations of lightning and hurricanes,
should yet exhibit none of those scenes of ruin and desolation
that might have been expected, but are always
found with the verdant characters of youth and beauty?
It is to the insect world that this great charge of keeping
the habitations of the Dryads in perpetual freshness has
been committed. A century almost would elapse before
the removal from the face of nature of the mighty ruins
of one of the hard-wooded tropical trees, by the mere influence
of the elements. But how speedy its decomposition
when their operations are assisted by insects! As
soon as a tree is fallen, one tribe attack its bark<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>, which
is often the most indestructible part of it; and thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
of orifices into the solid trunk are bored by others. The
rain thus insinuates itself into every part, and the action
of heat promotes the decomposition. Various fungi now
take possession and assist in the process, which is followed
up by the incessant attacks of other insects, that feed
only upon wood in an incipient state of decay. And thus
in a few months a mighty mass, which seemed inferior in
hardness only to iron, is mouldered into dust, and its
place occupied by younger trees full of life and vigour.
The insects to which this duty is intrusted have been already
mentioned in a former letter (p. <a href="#Page_235">235</a>&mdash;); but none
of them do their business so expeditiously or effectually
as the Termites, which ply themselves in such numbers
and so unremittingly, that Mr. Smeathman assures us
they will in a few weeks destroy and carry away the trunks
of large trees, without leaving a particle behind; and in
places where, two or three years before, there has been a
populous town, if the inhabitants, as is frequently the
case, have chosen to abandon it, there shall be a very
thick wood, and not the vestige of a post to be seen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I observed in a former letter, that the devastations of
insects are not the same in every season, their power of
mischief being evident only at certain times, when Providence,
by permitting an unusual increase of their numbers,
gives them a commission to lay waste any particular
country or district. The great agents in preventing
this increase, and keeping the noxious species within
proper limits, are other insects; and to these I shall now
call your attention.</p>

<p>Numerous are the tribes upon which this important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
task devolves, and incalculable are the benefits which
they are the means of bestowing upon us; for to them
we are indebted, or rather to Providence who created
them for this purpose, that our crops and grain, our cattle,
our fruit- and forest-trees, our pulse and flowers, and
even the verdant covering of the earth, are not totally
destroyed. Of these insects, so friendly to man, some
exercise their destructive agency solely while in the larva
state; others in the perfect state only; others in both
these states; and lastly, others again in all the three states
of larva, pupa, and imago. For order's sake, and to give
you a more distinct view of the subject, I shall say something
on each separately.</p>

<p>The first, those which are insectivorous only in their
<i>larva</i> state, maybe further subdivided into <i>parasites</i> and
<i>imparasites</i>, meaning by the former term those that feed
upon a <i>living</i> insect, and only destroy it when they have
attained their full growth; and by the latter, those that
prey upon insects already dead, or that kill them in the
act of devouring them.</p>

<p>The <i>imparasitic</i> insect devourers chiefly belong to the
<i>Hymenoptera</i> order; and though it is in the larva state
that their prowess is exhibited, the task of providing the
prey is usually left to the female, of which each species
for the most part selects a particular kind of insect. Thus
many species of <i>Cerceris</i> and the splendid <i>Chrysid√¶</i> or
golden wasps feed upon insects of their own order. One
of the latter (<i>Parnopes incarnata</i>) commits her eggs to
the progeny of <i>Bembex rostrata</i>: another (<i>Chrysis bidentata</i>)
attacks the young of <i>Epipone spinipes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bembex</i> and <i>Mellinus</i> confine themselves to <i>Diptera</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the former preying upon <i>Eristalis tenax</i>, <i>Bombylii</i>, and
the like<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>; the latter amongst others ridding us of the
troublesome <i>Stomoxys calcitrans</i>. One of these last I
have observed stationed on dung watching for flies,
which when seized, she carried to her burrow.</p>

<p><i>Epipone spinipes</i>, belonging to the family of Wasps,
feeds upon certain green apod larv√¶, of which the female
deposits ten or twelve with each egg. <i>Ammophila vulgaris</i>
destroys caterpillars of a larger size, and it is probable
that most of the other Vespoid and Sphecoid <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
viz. <i>Trypoxylon</i>, <i>Philanthus</i>, <i>Larra</i>, <i>Crabro</i>,
&amp;c. assist in this great work.</p>

<p><i>Pompilus</i>, to which genus probably several species mentioned
by Reaumur as preying on these insects should be
referred, has it in charge to keep the number of spiders
within due bounds: and some Sand-wasps lend their aid.
One of these last, mentioned by Catesby (<i>Pron√¶us c√¶ruleus</i>),
has been known to seize a spider eight times its
own weight<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>. Another species of this genus, which is
common in the Isle of France, attacks an insect still more
difficult, one would think, to turn to its purpose, the all-devouring
<i>Blatta</i> or cock-roach, and is therefore one of
the great benefactors to mankind. When this insect
perceives a Blatta (called there Kakerlac and Cancrelas)
it stops immediately: both animals eye each other; but
in an instant the sand-wasp darts upon its prey, seizes it
by the muzzle with its strong jaws, and bending its abdomen
underneath it, pierces it with its fatal sting. Sure
of its victim, it now walks or flies away, leaving the poison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to work its effect; but in a short time returns, and, finding
it deprived of power to make resistance, seizes it
again by the head, and drags it away, walking backwards
to deposit it in a hole or chink of a wall<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.</p>

<p>Grasshoppers are the prey of another sand-wasp, supposed
to be the <i>Sphex pensylvanica</i> of Linn√©, a native of
North America, each of which in its larva state devours
three of a large green species with which its mother has
provided it<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>.</p>

<p>From none of the imparasitic insectivorous larv√¶ do
we derive more advantage than from those which devour
the destructive Aphides, whose ravages, as we have seen
above, are more detrimental to us in this island than
those of any other insect. A great variety of species, of
different orders and genera, are employed to keep them
within due limits. There is a beautiful genus of four-winged
flies, whose wings resemble the finest lace, and
whose eyes are often as brilliant as burnished metals
(<i>Hemerobius</i>), the larv√¶ of which, Reaumur, from their
being insatiable devourers of them, has named the lions
of the Aphides. The singular pedunculated eggs from
which these larv√¶ proceed I shall describe when we
come to treat upon the eggs of insects; the larv√¶ themselves
are furnished with a pair of long crooked mandibles
resembling horns, which terminate in a sharp point,
and like those of the ant-lion are perforated, serving the
insect instead of a mouth; for through this orifice the
nutriment passes down into the stomach. When amongst
the Aphides, like wolves in a sheep-fold, they make
dreadful havoc: half a minute suffices them to suck the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
largest; and the individuals of one species clothe themselves,
like Hercules, with the spoils of their hapless
victims.</p>

<p>Next in importance to these come the aphidivorous
flies (many species of <i>Syrphid√¶</i>), whose grubs are armed
with a singular mandible, furnished like a trident with
three points, with which they transfix their prey. They
may often be seen laid at their ease under a leaf or upon
a twig, environed by such hosts of Aphides, that they
can devour hundreds without changing their station;
and their silly helpless prey, who are provided with no
means of defence, so far from thinking of escaping, frequently
walk over the back of their enemy, and put
themselves in his way. When disposed to feed, he fixes
himself by his tail, and, being blind, gropes about on
every side, as the Cyclops did for Ulysses and his companions,
till he touches one, which he immediately transfixes
with his trident, elevates into the air, that he may
not be disturbed by its struggles, and soon devours.
The havoc which these grubs make amongst the Aphides
is astonishing. It was but last week that I observed the
top of every young shoot of the currant-trees in my garden
curled up by myriads of these insects. On examining
them this day, not an individual remained; but beneath
each leaf are three or four full-fed larv√¶ of aphidivorous
flies, surrounded with heaps of the skins of the
slain, the trophies of their successful warfare; and the
young shoots, whose progress had been entirely checked
by the abstraction of sap, are again expanding vigorously.</p>

<p>But even these serviceable insects must yield the palm
to the lady-bird or lady-cow (<i>Coccinella</i>), the favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of our childhood, which, as well as most of its congeners,
in the larva state feeds entirely on Aphides<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>; and
the havoc made amongst them may be conceived from
the myriads upon myriads of these little interesting animals,
which are often to be seen in years when the plant-louse
abounds. In 1807 the shore at Brighton and all
the watering-places on the south coast was literally covered
with them, to the great surprise and even alarm of
the inhabitants, who were ignorant that their little visitors
were emigrants from the neighbouring hop-grounds,
where in their larva state each had slain his thousands
and tens of thousands of the Aphis, which under the
name of the <i>Fly</i> so frequently blasts the hopes of the
hop-grower. It is fortunate that in most countries the
children have taken these friendly Coccinell√¶ under
their protection. In France they regard them as sacred
to the Virgin, and call them <i>Vaches √† Dieu</i>, <i>B√™tes de la
Vierge</i>, &amp;c.; and with us, commiseration for the hard
fate of a mother, whose "house is on fire and children
at home," ensures them kind treatment and liberty.
Even the hop-growers are becoming sensible of their
services, and, as I am informed, hire boys to prevent
birds from destroying them.&mdash;If we could but discover a
mode of increasing these insects at will, we might not
only, as Dr. Darwin has suggested, clear our hot-houses
of Aphides by their means, but render our crops of hops
much more certain than they now are. Even without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
this knowledge, nothing is more easy, as I have experienced,
than to clear a plant or small tree by placing
upon it several larv√¶ of Coccinell√¶ or of aphidivorous
flies collected from less valuable vegetables.</p>

<p>Lastly, to close this list of imparasitic insectivorous
larv√¶, I may mention those of Geoffroy's genus <i>Volucella</i>
so remarkable for their radiated anus, which live
in the nests of humble-bees, braving the fury of their
stings and devouring their young; and the ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon</i>)
and Reaumur's improperly named worm-lion
(<i>Leptis</i>), whose singular stratagems will be detailed in
a subsequent letter, both of which destroy great numbers
of insects that are so unfortunate as to fall into their
toils.</p>

<p>The <i>parasitic</i> larv√¶, an extremely numerous tribe,
must next be considered. These, with the exception of
a very few individuals, belong to the order <i>Hymenoptera</i>,
and were included by Linn√© under his vast genus
<i>Ichneumon</i>, so named from the analogy between their
services and those of the Egyptian Ichneumons (<i>Viverra
Ichneumon</i>), the former as destroyers of insects, being
equally important with the latter as devourers of serpents,
the eggs of crocodiles, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The habits of the whole of this tribe<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>, which properly
includes a great number of distinct genera, are similar.
They all oviposit in living insects, chiefly while in the
larva state, sometimes while pup√¶ (<i>Misocampus Puparum</i>);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and even while in the egg state (<i>Ich. Ovulorum</i>,
L<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.); but not, as far as is known, in perfect insects. The
eggs thus deposited soon hatch into grubs, which immediately
attack their victim, and in the end ensure its
destruction. The number of eggs committed to each
individual varies according to its size, and that of the
grubs which are to spring from them; being in most
cases one only, but in others amounting to some hundreds.</p>

<p>From the observations hitherto made by entomologists,
the great body of the Ichneumon tribe is principally
employed in keeping within their proper limits the infinite
host of <i>lepidopterous</i> larv√¶, destroying, however,
many insects of other orders; and perhaps if the larv√¶
of these last fell equally under our observation with those
of the former, we might discover that few exist uninfested
by their appropriate parasite. Such is the activity
and address of the Ichneumonidans, and their <i>minute</i>
allies (<i>Pupivora</i>, Latr.), that scarcely any concealment,
except perhaps the waters, can secure their prey from
them; and neither bulk, courage, nor ferocity avail to
terrify them from effecting their purpose. They attack
the ruthless spider in his toils; they discover the retreat
of the little bee, that for safety bores deep into timber;
and though its enemy Ichneumon cannot enter its cell,
by means of her long ovipositor<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> she reaches the helpless
grub, which its parent vainly thought secured from every
foe, and deposits in it an egg, which produces a larva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
that destroys it<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>. In vain does the destructive <i>Cecidomyia</i>
of the wheat conceal its larv√¶ within the glumes
that so closely cover the grain; three species of these
minute benefactors of our race, sent in mercy by Heaven,
know how to introduce their eggs into them, thus preventing
the mischief they would otherwise occasion, and
saving mankind from the horrors of famine<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>. In vain
also the <i>Cynips</i> by its magic touch produces the curious
excrescences on various trees and plants, called galls,
for the nutriment and defence of its progeny: the parasite
species attached to it discovers its secret chamber,
pierces its wall however thick, and commits the destroying
egg to its offspring. Even the clover-weevil is not
secure within the legumen of that plant; nor the wire-worm
in the earth, from their ichneumonidan foes. I
have received from the late Mr. Markwick that of the
former, and Mr. Paul has shown me the destroyer of the
latter, which belongs to Latreille's genus <i>Proctotrupes</i>.
Others are not more secured by the repulsive nature of
the substance they inhabit; for two species at least of
Ichneumon<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> know how to oviposit it in stercorarious
larv√¶ without soiling their wings or bodies.</p>

<p>The ichneumonidan parasites are either external or
internal. Thus the species above alluded to, which
attacks spiders, does not live within their bodies, but
remains on the outside<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>; and the larva of <i>Ophion luteum</i>,
which adheres by one end to the shell of the bulbiferous
egg that produced it, does not enter the caterpillar of
<i>Euprepia villica</i>, the moth upon which it feeds<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the great majority of these animals oviposit within the
body of the insect to which they are assigned, from
whence, after having consumed the interior and become
pup√¶, they emerge in their perfect state. An idea of
the services rendered to us by those Ichneumons which
prey upon noxious larv√¶ may be formed from the fact,
that out of thirty individuals of the common cabbage
caterpillar (the larv√¶ of <i>Pontia Brassic√¶</i>) which Reaumur
put into a glass to feed, twenty-five were fatally
pierced by an Ichneumon (<i>Microgaster globatus</i><a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>). And
if we compare the myriads of caterpillars that often attack
our cabbages and broccoli with the small number of butterflies
of this species which usually appear, we may conjecture
that they are commonly destroyed in some such
proportion&mdash;a circumstance that will lead us thankfully
to acknowledge the goodness of Providence, which by
providing such a check has prevented the utter destruction
of the Brassica genus, including some of our most
esteemed and useful vegetables.</p>

<p>The parasites are not wholly confined to the order
<i>Hymenoptera</i>: some insects of other orders, though comparatively
very few, destroy our little enemies in the
same way. <i>Tachina Larvarum</i>, and another like it described
by De Geer, lay their eggs in caterpillars and
other larv√¶<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>; and Reaumur describes several other flies
of similar habits<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>. The order also of <i>Strepsiptera</i>, lately
established<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>, appears to be altogether parasitic; but
with this difference from the <i>Pupivora</i>, that these extraordinary
animals are found only upon <i>Hymenoptera</i>
in their perfect state, and do not appear to destroy the
insects upon which they prey, but probably prevent their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
breeding. The species at present known are formed
into two genera, <i>Xenos</i> and <i>Stylops</i>, which are confined
to <i>Melitta</i><a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> and <i>Vespa</i><a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.</p>

<p>The next description of insect destroyers are those
which devour them in their <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> states.&mdash;No
beetles are more common after the summer is confirmed,
than the species of the genus <i>Telephorus</i>. Preysler informs
us that the grub of <i>T. fuscus</i> destroys a great many
other larv√¶<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>, and I have observed the imago devour
these and also <i>Diptera</i>.&mdash;Linn√© has with justice denominated
the <i>Cicindel√¶</i> the tigers of insects. Though decorated
with brilliant colours, they prey upon the whole
insect race; their formidable jaws which cross each
other are armed with fearful fangs, showing to what use
they are applicable; and the extreme velocity with
which they can either run or fly, renders hopeless any
attempt to elude their pursuit. Their larv√¶ are also
equally tremendous with the imago, having eight eyes,
four on each side, seated on a lateral elevation of the
head, two above and two very minute below, which look
like those of spiders, and besides their threatening jaws
armed with a strong internal tooth, being furnished with
a pair of spines resembling somewhat the sting of a scorpion,
which stand erect upon the back of the abdomen,
and give them a most ferocious aspect<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>. This last apparatus,
according to Clairville, serves the purpose of an
anchor for retaining them at any height in their deep
cells<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>. Most of the aquatic beetles, at least the Gyrini
and Dytisci, prey upon other insects both in their first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
and final state. The larv√¶ of the latter have long been
observed and described under the name of <i>Squill√¶</i>, and
are remarkable for having their mandibles adapted for
suction like those of Hemerobius and Myrmeleon; but
they are not like them deprived of a mouth, being able
to devour by mastication as well as by suction.&mdash;Another
tribe of this order which abounds in species, those predaceous
beetles which form Linn√©'s great genus <i>Carabus</i>
(<i>Eutrechina</i><a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>), is universally insectivorous. One of the
most destructive is the grub of a very beautiful species,
an English specimen of which would be a great acquisition
to your cabinet, it being one of our rarest insects<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>,
I mean <i>Calosoma Sycophanta</i>. This animal takes up its
station in the nests of <i>Lasiocampa processionea</i> and other
moths, and sometimes fills itself so full with these caterpillars,
which we cannot handle or even approach without
injury, as to be rendered incapable of motion and appear
ready to burst. Another beautiful insect of this tribe,
<i>Carabus auratus</i>, known in France by the name of <i>Vinaigrier</i>,
is supposed to destroy more cockchafers than
all their other enemies, attacking and killing the females
at the moment of oviposition, and thus preventing the
birth of thousands of young grubs<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>. Lastly come the
<i>Brachyptera</i>, many of which prey upon insects as well
as on putrescent substances. Mr. Lehmann tells us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
some of them are very useful in destroying a weevil, <i>Apion
flavifemoratum</i><a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>, the great enemy of our crops of clover
seed.</p>

<p>Amongst the devourers of insects in their <i>perfect</i> state
only, must be ranked a few of the social tribes, ants,
wasps, and hornets. The first-mentioned indefatigable
and industrious creatures kill and carry off great numbers
of insects of every description to their nests, and
prodigious are their efforts in this work. I have seen an
ant dragging a wild bee many times bigger than itself;
and there was brought to me this very morning while
writing this letter, an <i>Elater</i> quite alive and active, which
three or four ants in spite of its struggles were carrying
off. An observing friend of mine<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>, who was some time
in Antigua, informed me that in that island, a kind of ant
which construct their nests in the roofs of houses, when
they meet with any animal larger than they can carry off
alive, such as a cock-roach, &amp;c., will hold it by the legs
so that it cannot move, till some of them get upon it and
dispatch it, and then with incredible labour carry it up
to their nest. Madam Merian, in her account of the
periodical ants mentioned to you before<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>, and which is
confirmed by Azara<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>, notices their clearing the houses
of cock-roaches and similar animals; and <i>Myrmica omnivora</i>
is very useful in Ceylon in destroying the former
insect, the larger ant, and the white ant<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>.</p>

<p>You are not perhaps accustomed to regard wasps and
hornets as of any use to us; but they certainly destroy an
infinite number of flies and other annoying insects. The
year 1811 was remarkable for the small number of wasps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
though many females appeared in the spring, scarcely
any neuters being to be seen in the autumn<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>; and probably
in consequence of this circumstance, flies in many
places were so extremely numerous as to be quite a nuisance.
Reaumur has observed that in France the butchers
are very glad to have wasps attend their stalls, for the
sake of their services in driving away the flesh-fly; and
if we may believe the author of Hector St. John's <i>American
Letters</i>, the farmers in some parts of the United
States are so well aware of their utility in this respect, as
to suspend in their sitting-rooms a hornet's nest, the occupants
of which prey upon the flies without molesting
the family.</p>

<p>There are other devourers of insects in their perfect
state, the manners and food of whose larv√¶ we are unacquainted
with. St. Pierre speaks of a lady-bird, but
it probably belonged to some other genus, of a fine violet
colour, with a head like a ruby, which he saw carry off
a butterfly<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>. Linn√© informs us that <i>Clerus formicarius</i>
devours <i>Anobium pertinax</i>. A fly related to the <i>Panorpa
communis</i> appears created to instill terror into the
pitiless hearts of the tyrants of our lakes and pools,&mdash;the
all-devouring <i>Libellulina</i><a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>. The <i>Asili</i> also, which
are always upon the chase, seize insects with their anterior
legs and suck them with their haustellum. The
cognate genus <i>Dioctria</i>, particularly <i>D. &#339;landica</i>, prey
upon <i>Hymenoptera</i>, by some unknown means instantaneously
killing the insect they seize. Many species also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of <i>Empis</i>, whose haustellum resembles the beak of a bird,
carry off in it <i>Tipulari√¶</i> and other small <i>Diptera</i>; and
what is remarkable, you can seldom take these insects in
coitu, but the female has a gnat, some fly, or sometimes
beetle, in her mouth. Can this be to deposit her eggs
in, as soon as they are impregnated by the male? or is
it designed for the nuptial feast? Even <i>Scatophaga stercoraria</i>
and <i>scybalaria</i>, and probably many others of the
same tribe, feed upon small flies, though their proboscis
does not seem so well adapted for animal as for vegetable
food.</p>

<p>The most unrelenting devourers of insects appear to
be those belonging to my fourth division, which attack
them under <i>every</i> form. These begin the work of destruction
when they are larv√¶, and continue it during
the whole of their existence.&mdash;The earwig that haunts
every close place in our gardens, and defiles whatever
it enters, probably in some degree makes up for its ravages
by diminishing the number of other insects. The
cowardly and cruel <i>Mantis</i>, which runs away from an
ant, will destroy in abundance helpless flies, using its
anterior tibi√¶, which with the thigh form a kind of forceps,
to seize its prey. The water-scorpions (<i>Nepa</i>,
<i>Ranatra</i>, and <i>Naucoris</i>), whose fore legs are made like
those of the <i>Mantis</i>, the water-boatman (<i>Notonecta</i>),
which always swims upon its back, and <i>Sigara</i>, all live
by rapine, and prey upon aquatic insects. Some of this
tribe are so savage that they seem to love destruction for
its own sake. One (<i>Nepa cinerea</i>) which was put into a
basin of water with several young tadpoles, killed them
all without attempting to eat one.</p>

<p>Those remarkable genera of the tribe of water-bugs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
(<i>Hydrocoris√¶</i> Latr.), which glide over the surface of
every pool with such rapidity, being gifted with the faculty
of walking upon the water, <i>Hydrometra</i>, <i>Velia</i>,
and <i>Gerris</i>, subsist also upon aquatic insects. A large
number of the land-bugs (<i>Geocoris√¶</i> Latr.) plunge their
rostrum into the larv√¶ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, and suck the
contents of their bodies; and <i>Reduvius personatus</i>, which
ought on that account to be encouraged, is particularly
fond of the bed-bug.</p>

<p>But of all the insects that are locomotive and pursue
their prey in every state, none are greater enemies of
their fellow tribes than the <i>Libellulina</i>, and none are
provided with more powerful and singular instruments
of assault. In the larva and pupa states, during which
they live in the water and prey upon aquatic insects,
they are furnished with two pair of strong jaws, covered
by a kind of mask armed with a pair of forceps or claws,
which the animal has the power of pushing from it to
catch any thing at a distance<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>. When an aquatic insect
passes within its reach, it suddenly darts forth the mask,
opens the forceps, seizes the unfortunate victim, and
brings it within the action of its jaws.</p>

<p>When they assume the imago state, their habits do
not, like those of the white ants, become more mild and
gentle, but on the contrary are more sanguinary and rapacious
than ever; so that the name given to them in
England, "Dragon-flies," seems much more applicable
than "Demoiselles," by which the French distinguish
them. Their motions it is true are light and airy; their
dress is silky, brilliant and variegated, and trimmed with
the finest lace:&mdash;so far the resemblance holds; but their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
purpose, except at the time of love, is always destruction,
in which surely they have no resemblance to the ladies.
I have been much amused by observing the proceedings
of a species not uncommon here, <i>Anax Imperator</i> of
Dr. Leach. It keeps wheeling round and round, and
backwards and forwards, over a considerable portion of
the pool it frequents. If one of the same species comes in
its way, a battle ensues; if other species of <i>Libellulina</i>
presume to approach, it drives them away, and it is continually
engaged in catching case-worm flies and other
insects (for the species of this tribe all catch their prey
when on the wing, and their large eyes seem given them
to enable them the more readily to do this,) that fly over
the water, pulling off their wings with great adroitness
and devouring in an instant the contents of the body.
From the number of insects of this tribe which are every
where to be observed, we may conjecture how useful
they must be in preventing too great a multiplication of
the other species of the class to which they belong.</p>

<p>Lastly, under this head, not to dwell upon some other
apterous genera, devourers of insects, as the scorpion and
centipede, <i>Phalangium</i> and <i>Galeodes</i>, must be enumerated
the whole world of Spiders, extremely numerous
both in species and individuals, which subsist entirely
upon insects, spreading with infinite art and skill their
nets and webs to arrest the flight of the heedless and
unwary summer tribes that fill the air, which are hourly
caught by thousands in their toils; one of them (<i>Theridium</i>
13-<i>guttatum</i> Rossi), we are told, even attacking the
redoubted Scorpion<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>.</p>

<p>So much for the insect benefactors to whom it is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
in charge to keep the animals of their own class within
their proper limits; and I cannot doubt that you will recognise
the goodness of the Great Parent in providing
such an army of counterchecks to the natural tendency
of almost all insects to incalculable increase. But before
I quit this subject I must call your attention to what may
be denominated <i>cannibal insects</i>, since in spite of those
declaimers who would persuade us that man is the only
animal that preys upon his own species<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>, a large number
of insects are guilty of the same offence. Reaumur tells
us, that having put into a glass vessel twenty caterpillars
of the same species, which he was careful to supply with
their appropriate food, they nevertheless devoured each
other until one only survived<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>; and De Geer relates several
similar instances<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>. The younger larv√¶ of <i>Calosoma
Sycophanta</i> often take advantage of the helpless inactivity
into which the gluttony of their maturer comrades has
thrown them, and from mere wantonness it should seem,
when in no need of other food, pierce and devour them. A
ferocity not less savage exists amongst the <i>Mantes</i>. These
insects have their fore legs of a construction not unlike
that of a sabre; and they can as dexterously cleave their
antagonist in two, or cut off his head at a stroke, as the
most expert hussar. In this way they often treat each other,
even the sexes fighting with the most savage animosity.
R√∂sel endeavoured to rear several specimens of <i>M. religiosa</i>,
but always failed, the stronger constantly devouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the weaker<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>. This ferocious propensity the Chinese
children have, according to Mr. Barrow, employed as a
source of barbarous amusement, selling to their comrades
bamboo cages containing each a <i>Mantis</i>, which are put
together to fight. You will think it singular that both
in Europe and Africa these cruel insects have obtained
a character for gentleness of disposition, and even sanctity.
This has arisen from the upright or sitting position,
with the fore legs bent, assumed in watching for
their prey, which the vulgar have supposed to be a praying
posture, and hence adopted the belief that a child or
traveller that had lost his road would be guided by taking
one of these pious insects in his hands and observing
what way it pointed. <i>Mantis fausta</i>, though not as some
suppose worshiped by the Hottentots, is yet greatly esteemed
by them, and they regard the person upon whom
it alights as highly fortunate<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>. A similar unnatural ferocity
is exhibited by <i>Gryllus campestris</i>, of which having
put the sexes into a box, I found on examining them
that the female had begun to make her meal off her companion.&mdash;The
malign aspect of the scorpion leads us to
expect from it unnatural cruelty, and its manners fulfill
this expectation. Maupertuis put a hundred scorpions
together, and a general and murderous battle immediately
began. Almost all were massacred in the space of
a few days without distinction of age or sex, and devoured
by the survivors. He informs us also that they
often devour their own offspring as soon as they are
born<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>. Spiders are equally ferocious in their habits,
fighting sanguinary battles, which sometimes end in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
death of both combatants; and the females do not yield
to the Mantes in their unnatural cruelty to their mates.
Woe be to the male spider that after an union does not
with all speed make his escape from the fangs of his partner!
Nay, De Geer saw one that, in the midst of his
preparatory caresses, was seized by the object of his attentions,
enveloped by her in a web, and then devoured&mdash;a
sight which, he observes, filled him with horror and
indignation<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are the benefits which we derive from the insects
that keep each other in check. Here they are the <i>destroyers</i>
to which we are chiefly indebted: but we are in
another point of view under nearly equal obligations to
the <i>destroyed</i>; for they are insects, either wholly or in
part, that form the food of some of our most esteemed
fishes, and of birds that are not more valuable to us as
articles for the table, than as the songsters that enliven
our groves. But before proceeding to the details which
this view of the subject involves, I ought not to omit
pointing out to you that many quadrupeds, which though
not all of direct utility to us are doubtless of importance
in the scale of being, derive a considerable part of their
subsistence from insects.</p>

<p>The harmless hedgehog and the mole, to begin at the
lower end of the series, are both said to be insectivorous<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>;
the latter devouring large quantities of the wire-worms.
The greedy swine will root up whole acres in search of
the grubs of cockchafers, of which they are very fond;
and perhaps the good they do is greater than the harm,
if their attack be confined to grass that having been undermined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
by these grubs would soon die: they also dig
up the larv√¶ of the destructive <i>Cicada septendecim</i>,
called the American locust<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>, on which, when in their
perfect state, the squirrels are said to grow fat<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>. The
badger, Lesser informs us, will eat beetles: and its kinsman
the bear has the character of being very fond of ants
and of honey; which last is also said to be a favourite
article with the fox, who has sometimes the audacity to
overturn bee-hives, and even to attack wasps' nests in
search of it. He will also eat beetles.</p>

<p>Sparrman has given an amusing account of the honey-ratel,
(<i>Viverra mellivora</i>,) which has a particular instinct
enabling it to discover bees, and attack them in their
entrenchments. Near sun-set the ratel will sit and hold
one of his paws before his eyes, in order to get a distinct
view of the object of his pursuit; and when, in consequence
of his peering about in this manner, he sees any
bees flying, he knows that at this time of the day they
are making for their habitations, whither he follows them,
and so attains his end<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>. Another species of Viverra
(<i>V. prehensilis</i>) is also reputed to be an eager insect-hunter.
The young armadillos feed on a species of
locust; but no quadruped can with more propriety be
called insectivorous than the ant-eaters (<i>Myrmecophaga</i>),
which, as their name imports, live upon ants. The great
ant-eater, when he comes to an ant-hill, scratches it up
with his long claws, and then unfolds his slender worm-like
tongue, (which is more than two feet long, and wet
with saliva,) and when covered with ants draws it back
into his mouth and swallows thousands of them alive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
renewing the operation till no more are to be found. He
also climbs trees in search of wood-lice and wild-honey.
Bats, as every one knows, are always flitting about in
summer evenings, hawking for insects: and the Lemur
and monkeys will also eat them.</p>

<p>Insects likewise afford a favourite kind of food to many
reptiles: the tortoise; frogs and toads; and lizards too
of different kinds. St. Pierre mentions a small and very
handsome species in the island of Mauritius, that pursues
them into the houses, climbs up the walls, and even
walks over glass, watching with great patience for an
opportunity of catching them<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>. The common snake also
is said to receive part of its nutriment from them.</p>

<p>But to revert to insects as indirectly advantageous to
us, by furnishing food to fishes and birds, beginning
with the former.</p>

<p>Our rivers abound with <i>fish</i> of various kinds, which
at particular seasons derive a principal part of their food
from insects, as the numerous species of the salmon and
carp genus. These chiefly prey upon the various kinds
of <i>Trichoptera</i>, in their larva state called case- or caddis-worms,
and in their imago may-flies (though this last
denomination properly belongs only to the <i>Sialis lutaria</i>,
which generally appears in that month,) and <i>Ephemer√¶</i>.
Besides these, the waters swarm with insects of every
order, as numerous in proportion to the space they
inhabit, as those that fill the air, which form the sole
nutriment of multitudes of our fish, and the partial support
of almost all.</p>

<p>Reaumur has given us a very entertaining account
of the infinite hosts of Ephemer√¶ that by myriads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
millions emerge at a certain season of the year from some
of the rivers in France, which, as it is well worth your
attention, I shall abridge for you.</p>

<p>These insects in their first and intermediate state are
aquatic: they either live in holes in the banks of rivers
or brooks below the water, so that it enters into their
habitations, which they seldom quit; or they swim about
and walk upon the bed of the stream, or conceal themselves
under stones or upon pieces of stick. Though their
life, when they assume the perfect state, is usually extremely
short, some being disclosed after sun-set, laying
their eggs and dying before sun-rise; and many not
living more than three hours; yet in their preparatory
state their existence is much longer, in some one, in
others two, in others even three years.</p>

<p>The different species assume the imago at different
times of the year; but the same species appear regularly
at nearly the same period annually, and for a certain
number of days fill the air in the neighbourhood of the
rivers, emerging also from the water at a certain hour of
the day. Those which Swammerdam observed, began
to fly about six o'clock in the evening, or about two hours
before sun-set; but the great body of those noticed by
Reaumur did not appear till after that time; so that the
season of different harvests is not better known to the
farmer, than that in which the Ephemer√¶ of a particular
river are to emerge, is to the fishermen. Yet a greater
degree of heat or cold, the rise or fall of the water, and
other circumstances we are not aware of, may accelerate
or retard their appearance. Between the 10th and 15th
of August is the time when those of the Seine and Marne,
which Reaumur described, are expected by the fishermen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
who call them <i>manna</i>: and when their season is
come, they say "the manna begins to appear, the manna
fell abundantly such a night;"&mdash;alluding, by this expression,
either to the astonishing quantity of food which the
Ephemer√¶ afford the fish, or to the large quantity of
fish which they then take.</p>

<p>Reaumur first observed these insects in the year 1738,
when they did not begin to show themselves in numbers
till the 18th of August. On the 19th, having received
notice from his fisherman that the flies had appeared, he
got into his boat about three hours before sun-set, and
detached from the banks of the river several masses of
earth filled with pup√¶, which he put into a large tub full
of water. This tub, after staying in the boat till about
eight o'clock, without seeing any remarkable number of
the flies, and being threatened with a storm, he caused
to be landed and placed in his garden, at the foot of
which ran the Marne. Before the people had landed it,
an astonishing number of Ephemer√¶ emerged from it.
Every piece of earth that was above the surface of the
water was covered by them, some beginning to quit their
slough, others prepared to fly, and others already on the
wing; and every where under the water they were to be
seen in a greater or less degree of forwardness. The
storm coming on, he was obliged to quit the amusing
scene; but when the rain ceased to fall he returned to it.
As soon as the cloth with which he had ordered the tub
to be covered was removed, the number of flies appeared
to be greatly augmented, and kept continually increasing:
many flew away, but more were drowned. Those already
transformed, and continually transforming, would
have been sufficient of themselves to have made the tub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
seem full; but their number was soon very much enlarged
by others attracted by the light. To prevent their
being drowned, he caused the tub to be again covered
with the cloth, and over it he held the light, which was
soon concealed by a layer of these flies, that might have
been taken by handfulls from the candlestick.</p>

<p>But the scene round the tub was nothing to be compared
with the wonderful spectacle exhibited on the
banks of the river. The exclamations of his gardener
drew the illustrious naturalist thither: and such a sight
he had never witnessed, and could scarcely find words
to describe. "The myriads of Ephemer√¶," says he,
"which filled the air over the current of the river, and
over the bank on which I stood, are neither to be expressed
nor conceived. When the snow falls with the
largest flakes, and with the least interval between them,
the air is not so full of them as that which surrounded
us was of Ephemer√¶. Scarcely had I remained in one
place a few minutes, when the step on which I stood was
quite concealed with a layer of them from two to four
inches in depth. Near the lowest step a surface of water
of five or six feet dimensions every way was entirely and
thickly covered by them: and what the current carried
off was continually replaced. Many times I was obliged
to abandon my station, not being able to bear the shower
of Ephemer√¶, which, falling with an obliquity less constant
than that of an ordinary shower, struck continually,
and in a manner extremely uncomfortable, every part
of my face:&mdash;eyes, mouth and nostrils were filled with
them." To hold the flambeau on this occasion was no
pleasant office. The person who filled it had his clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
covered in a few moments with these flies, which came
from all parts to overwhelm him.&mdash;Before ten o'clock
this interesting spectacle had vanished. It was renewed
for some nights afterwards, but the flies were never in
such prodigious numbers. The fishermen allow only
three successive days for the great fall of the manna:
but a few flies appear both before and after, their number
increasing in one case, in the other diminishing.
Whatever be the temperature of the atmosphere, whether
it be cold or hot, these flies invariably appear at the same
hour in the evening, that is, between a quarter and half-past
eight: towards nine they begin to fill the air; in
the following half-hour they are in the greatest numbers;
and at ten there are scarcely any to be seen. So
that in less than two hours this infinite host of flies emerge
from their parent stream, fill the air, perform their appointed
work, and vanish. A very large proportion of
them falls into the river, when the fish have their grand
festival and the fishermen a good harvest<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>.</p>

<p>Under this head I may observe how much the patient
angler is indebted to insects for some of his choicest
baits, for the best opportunities of showing his skill, and
for the most gratifying part of his diversion. The case-worm
and several other larv√¶ are the best standing bait
for many fish. The larva of the Ephemera, there called
bait and bank-bait<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>, is much used in some parts of Holland.
The case-worms, and grubs (I suppose of flies)
from the tallow-chandlers are in request with us for
roach and dace; and I am told by an acute observer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
these things, the Rev. R. Sheppard, that the <i>Geotrupes</i>
and <i>Melolonth√¶</i> are good baits for chub<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>. But to be an
adept in fly-fishing, which requires the most skill and
furnishes the best diversion, the angler ought to be conversant
in Entomology, at least sufficiently so to distinguish
the different species of <i>Phryganea</i> and other <i>Trichoptera</i>,
and to know the time of their appearance.&mdash;The
angler is not only indebted to insects for some of
his best baits, but also for the best material to fasten his
hooks to, and even for making his lines for smaller fish&mdash;the
Indian grass or gut as it is called, (termed in
France <i>Cheveux de Florence</i>,) which is said to be prepared
in China from the matter contained in the silk
reservoirs of the silk-worm, but according to Latreille is
the silk vessel itself when dried<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the most important ends for which insects were
gifted with such powers of multiplication, giving birth to
myriads of myriads of individuals, was to furnish the
feathered part of the creation with a sufficient supply of
food. The number of birds that derive the whole or a
principal part of their subsistence from insects is, as is
universally known, very great, and includes species of
almost every order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Accipitres</i> the kestril (<i>Falco Tinnunculus</i>,
L.) devours abundance of insects. A friend of mine,
upon opening one found its stomach full of the remains
of grasshoppers and beetles, particularly the former,
which he suspects constitute great part of the food of
this species. One of the shrikes, also, or butcher-birds
(<i>Lanius Collurio</i>)&mdash;and it is probable that other species
of this numerous genus may have the same habits&mdash;is
known to feed upon insects, which it first impales alive
on the thorns of the sloe and other spinous plants, and
then devours. If meat be given it, when kept in a cage,
it will fix it upon the wires before it eats it. <i>Lanius Excubitor</i>
also impales insects, but Heckewelder denies that
it feeds upon them. If he be correct, the object of this
singular procedure with that species, may be to allure
the birds, which it preys upon, to a particular spot<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>.</p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Pic√¶</i> or Pies the <i>Crotophaga</i>, called the
Ani, which is a native of Africa and America, lives upon
the locust and <i>Ixodes Ricinus</i>, which it picks in great
numbers from the backs of cattle; but none are greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
devourers of insects in this order than rooks. It is for the
grubs of <i>Melolontha</i>, <i>Tipula</i>, &amp;c., that they follow the
plough; and they always frequent the meadows in which
these larv√¶ abound, destroying them in vast numbers.
Kalm tells us, that when the little crow was extirpated
from Virginia at an enormous expense, the inhabitants
would willingly have brought them back again at double
the price<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>. The icteric oriole is kept by the Americans
in their houses for the sake of clearing them of insects;
and the purple grackle is so useful in this respect, that
when, on account of their consuming grain, the American
farmers in New England offered a reward of threepence
a head for them, and they were in consequence
nearly extirpated, insects increased to such a degree as
to cause a total loss of the herbage, and the inhabitants
were obliged to obtain hay for their cattle not only from
Pennsylvania but even from Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>. Of this
order also is the bee-cuckoo (<i>Cuculus Indicator</i>) so celebrated
for its instinct, by which it serves as a guide to
the wild bees' nests in Africa. Sparrman describes this
bird, which is somewhat larger than a common sparrow,
as giving this information in a singular manner. In the
evening and morning, which are its meal-times, it excites
the attention of the Hottentots, colonists, and honey-ratel,
by the cry of <i>cherr, cherr, cherr</i>, and conducts
them to the tree or spot in which the bees' nest is concealed,
continually repeating this cry. When arrived
at the spot, it hovers over it, and then alighting on some
neighbouring tree or bush, sits in silence, expecting to
come in for its share of the spoil, which is that part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
comb containing the brood<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>.&mdash;The wryneck and the
woodpeckers, the nut-hatch and tree-creeper, live entirely
upon insects and their eggs<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>, which they pick out
of decayed trees and out of the bark of living ones. The
former also frequents grass-plats and ant-hills, into which
it darts its long flexible tongue and so draws out its prey.
The woodpecker likewise draws insects out of their holes
by means of the same organ, which for this purpose is
bony at the end and barbed, and furnished with a curious
apparatus of muscles to enable them to throw it forwards
with great force. Some species spit the insects on their
tongue, and thus bring them into their mouth. In
America, the tree-creeper is furnished with a box at the
end of a long pole to entice it to build in gardens, which
it is found to be particularly useful in clearing from
noxious insects.</p>

<p>Amongst the <i>Grall√¶</i> or Waders, many of the long-billed
birds eat the larv√¶ of insects as well as worms:
and they form also no inconsiderable part of the food of
our domestic poultry, especially turkeys, which may be
daily seen busily engaged in hunting for them, and, as
well as ducks, will greedily devour the larger insects,
as cockchafers, and in North America <i>Cicad√¶</i>. Mr.
Sheppard was much amused one day in July last year
with observing a cow which had taken refuge in a pond,
probably from the gad-fly, and was standing nearly up
to its belly in water. A fleet of ducks surrounded it,
which kept continually jumping at the flies that alighted
upon it. The cow, as if sensible of the service they
were rendering her, stood perfectly still though assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
and pecked on all sides by them. The partridge takes
her young brood to an ant-hill, where they feast upon
the larv√¶ and pup√¶, which Swammerdam informs us
were sold at market in his time to feed various kinds of
birds<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>. Dr. Clarke also mentions having seen them, as
well as the ants themselves, exposed to sale in the market
at Moscow as a food for nightingales<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>. Latreille tells
us that singing birds are fed in France with the larv√¶ of
the horse-ant (<i>Formica rufa</i>).</p>

<p>But the Linnean order of <i>Passeres</i> affords the greatest
number of insectivorous birds; indeed almost all the species
of this order, except perhaps the pigeon-tribe, and
the cross-bill and other Loxi√¶, more or less eat insects.
Amongst the thrush tribe, the blackbird, though he will
have his share of our gooseberries and currants, assists
greatly in clearing our gardens of caterpillars; and the
locust-eating thrush is still more useful in the countries
subject to that dreadful pest: these birds never appear
but with the locusts, and then accompany them in astonishing
numbers, preying upon them in their larva state.
The common sparrow, though proscribed as a most mischievous
bird, destroys a vast number of insects. Bradley
has calculated that a single pair having young to maintain,
will destroy 3360 caterpillars in a week<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>. They
also prey upon butterflies and other winged insects. The
fly-catchers (<i>Muscicapa</i>) and the warblers (<i>Motacilla</i>),
which include our sweetest songsters, are almost entirely
supported by insects; so that were it not for these despised
creatures we should be deprived of some of our greatest
pleasures, and half the interest and delight of our vernal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
walks would be done away. Our groves would no longer
be vocal; our little domestic favourites the red-breast and
the wren would desert us; and the heavens would be depopulated.&mdash;We
should lose too some of the most esteemed
dainties of our tables, one of which, the wheat-ear, is
said to be attracted to our downs by a particular insect<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>.
Lastly, insects are the sole food of swallows, which are
always on the wing hawking for them, and their flight is
regulated by that of their prey. When the atmosphere
is dry and clear and their small game flies high, they seek
the skies; when moist and the insects are low or upon the
ground, they descend and just skim the surface of the
earth and waters; and thus by their flight are regarded
as prognosticating fair or wet weather. I was last summer
much interested and amused by observing the tender
care and assiduity with which an old swallow supplied
her young with this kind of food. My attention was
called to a young brood, that having left their nest before
they were strong enough to take wing, were stationed on
the lead which covers a bow window in my house. The
mother was perpetually going and returning, putting an
insect into the mouth first of one and then of the others
in succession, all fluttering and opening their mouths to
receive her gift. She was scarcely ever more than a
minute away, and continued her excursions as long as
we had time to observe her. When the little ones were
satisfied, they put their head under their wing and went
to sleep. The number of insects caught by this tribe is
inconceivable. But it is not in summer only that birds
derive their food from the insect tribes: even in winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the pup√¶ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, as Mr. White tells us, are the
grand support of those that have a soft bill<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I shall close my list of the indirect benefits derived
from insects, by adverting to the very singular apparent
subserviency of some of them to the functions of certain
vegetables.</p>

<p>You well know that some plants are gifted with the
faculty of catching flies. These vegetable Muscicap√¶,
which have been enumerated by Dr. Barton of Philadelphia,
who has published an ingenious paper on the
subject<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>, may be divided into three classes: First, those
that entrap insects by the irritability of their stamina,
which close upon them when touched. Under this head
come <i>Apocynum andros√¶mifolium</i>, <i>Asclepias syriaca</i> and
<i>curassavica</i>, <i>Nerium Oleander</i>, and a grass described by
Michaux under the name of <i>Leersia lenticularis</i>. The
second class includes those which entrap them by some
viscosity of the plant, as many species of <i>Rhododendron</i>,
<i>Kalmia</i>, <i>Robinia</i>, <i>Silene</i>, <i>Lythrum</i>, <i>Populus balsamifera</i>,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> And under the third class will arrange those which
ensnare by their leaves, whether from some irritability in
them, as in <i>Dion√¶a</i>, <i>Drosera</i>, &amp;c., or merely from their
forming hollow vessels containing water, into which the
flies are enticed either by their carrion-like odour, or the
sweet fluid which many of them secrete near the faux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
as in <i>Sarracenia</i>, <i>Nepenthes</i>, <i>Aquarium</i>, <i>Cephalotus</i>, &amp;c.,
the tubular leaves of which are usually found stored with
putrefying insects. In this last class may be placed the
common <i>Dipsacus</i> of this country, the connate leaves of
which form a kind of basin round the stem, that retains
rain-water in which many insects are drowned. To these
a fourth class might be added, consisting of those plants
whose flowers smelling like carrion (<i>Stapelia hirsuta</i>, &amp;c.)
entice flies to lay their eggs upon them, which thus
perish.</p>

<p>The number of insects thus destroyed is prodigious.
It is scarcely possible to find a flower of the <i>Muscicap√¶
Asclepiade√¶</i> that has not entrapped its victim, and some
of them in the United States closely cover hundreds of
acres together.</p>

<p>What may be the precise use of this faculty is not so
apparent. Dr. Barton doubts whether the flowers that
catch insects, being only temporary organs, can derive
any nutriment from them; and he does not think it probable
that the leaves of <i>Dion√¶a</i>, &amp;c., which are usually
found in rich boggy soil, can have any need of additional
stimulus. As nothing however is made in vain, there can
be little doubt that these ensnared insects are subservient
to some important purpose in the economy of the plants
which are endowed with the faculty of taking them,
though we may be ignorant what that purpose is; and
an experiment of Mr. Knight's, nurseryman in King's
Road, London, seems to prove that in the case of Dion√¶a,
at least, the very end in view, contrary to Dr. Barton's
supposition, is the supplying the leaves with animal manure;
for he found that a plant upon whose leaves he laid
fine filaments of raw beef, was much more luxuriant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
its growth than others not so treated<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>. Possibly the air
evolved from the putrefying insects with which <i>Sarracenia
purpurea</i> is sometimes so filled as to scent the atmosphere
round it, may be in a similar manner favourable to its
vegetation.</p>

<p>Most of the insects which are found in the tubular
leaves of this and similar plants enter into them voluntarily;
but Sir James Smith mentions a curious fact, from
which it appears that in some cases they are deposited
by other species. One of the gardeners of the Liverpool
Botanic Garden observed an insect, from the description
one of the <i>Crabronid√¶</i>, which dragged several large flies
to the <i>Sarracenia adunca</i>, and, having with some difficulty
forced them under the lid or cover of its leaf, deposited
them in its tubular part which was half filled
with water: and on examination all the leaves were
found crowded with dead or drowning flies<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>. What was
the object of this singular man&#339;uvre does not seem very
obvious. At the first glance one might suppose that,
having deposited an egg in the fly, it intended to avail
itself of the tube of the leaf instead of a burrow. Yet we
know of no such strange deviation from natural instinct,
which would be the more remarkable because the insect
was <i>European</i>, while the plant was American and growing
in a hot-house. And at any rate it does not seem very
likely that the insect would commit her egg to the tube
without having previously examined it; in which case
she must have discovered it to be half full of water, and
consequently unfit for her purpose.&mdash;It is not so wonderful
that many large flies should, as Professor Barton
informs us, drop their eggs into the Ascidia furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
with dead carcases: and it seems very probable that
Dytisci oviposit in them; for the Squilla which Rumphius
found there was probably one of their larv√¶, this being
the old name for them<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.</p>

<p>However problematical the agency of insects caught
by plants as to their <i>nutriment</i>, there can be no doubt
that many species perform an important function with
regard to their <i>impregnation</i>, which indeed without their
aid would in some cases never take place at all. Thus,
for the due fertilization of the common Barberry (<i>Berberis
vulgaris</i>) it is necessary that the irritable stamens
should be brought into contact with the pistil by the
application of some stimulus to the base of the filament;
but this would never take place were not insects attracted
by the melliferous glands of the flower to insinuate themselves
amongst the filaments, and thus, while seeking
their own food, unknowingly fulfill the intentions of nature
in another department<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.</p>

<p>The agency of these little operators is not less indispensable
in the beautiful tribe of <i>Iris</i>. In these, as appears
from the observations of K√∂lreuter, the true stigma is
situated on the upper side of a transverse membrane
(<i>arcus eminens</i> of Haller) which is stretched across the
middle of the under surface of the petal-like expansion
or style-flag, the whole of which has been often improperly
regarded as fulfilling the office of a stigma. Now
as the anther is situated at the base of the style-flag which
covers it, at a considerable distance from the stigma, and
at the same time cut off from all access to it, by the intervening
barrier formed by the <i>arcus eminens</i>, it is clear
that but for some extraneous agency the pollen could
never possibly arrive at the place of its destination. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
case the <i>humble-bee</i> is the operator. Led by instinct, or,
as the ingenious Sprengel supposes, by one of those
honey marks (<i>Saftmaal</i>) or spots of a different colour
from the rest of the corolla, which, according to him, are
placed in many flowers expressly to guide insects to the
nectaries, she pushes herself between the stiff style-flag
and elastic petal, which last, while she is in the interior,
presses her close to the anther, and thus causes her to
brush off the pollen with her hairy back, which ultimately,
though not at once, conveys it to the stigma.
Having exhausted the nectar she retreats backwards;
and in doing this, is indeed pressed by the petal to the
<i>arcus eminens</i>; but it is only to its lower or negative surface,
which cannot influence impregnation. She now
takes her way to the second petal, and insinuating herself
under its style-flag, her back comes into close contact
with the true stigma, which is thus impregnated with the
pollen of the first visited anther: and in this manner migrating
from one part of the corolla to another, and from
flower to flower, she fructifies one with pollen gathered
in her search after honey in another.&mdash;Mr. Sprengel
found, that not only are insects indispensable in fructifying
the different species of Iris, but that some of them, as
<i>I. Xiphium</i>, require the agency of the larger humble-bees,
which alone are strong enough to force their way beneath
the style-flag: and hence, as these insects are not so common
as many others, this Iris is often barren, or bears
imperfect seeds<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Aristolochia Clematitis</i>, according to Professor Willdenow,
is so formed, that the anthers of themselves cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
impregnate the stigma; but this important affair is devolved
upon a particular species of gnat (<i>Cecidomyia
pennicornis</i>). The throat of the flower is lined with dense
hair, pointing downward so as to form a kind of funnel
or entrance like that of some kinds of mouse-traps,
through which the insects may easily enter but not return:
several creep in, and, uneasy at their confinement,
are constantly moving to and fro, and so deposit the
pollen upon the stigma: but when the work entrusted to
them is completed, and impregnation has taken place,
the hair which prevented their escape shrinks, and adheres
closely to the sides of the flower, and these little
go-betweens of Flora at length leave their prison<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>. Sir
James Smith supposes that it is for want of some insect
of this kind that <i>Aristolochia Sipho</i> never forms fruit in
this country.</p>

<p>Equally important is the agency of insects in fructifying
the plants of the Linnean classes <i>Monoecia</i>, <i>Dioecia</i>
and <i>Polygamia</i>, in which the stamens are in one blossom
and the pistil in another. In exploring these for honey
and pollen, which last is the food of several insects besides
bees<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>, it becomes involved in the hair, with which
in many cases their bodies seem provided for this express
purpose, and is conveyed to the germen requiring its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
fertilizing influence. Sprengel supposes that with this
view some plants have particular insects appropriated to
them, as to the dioecious nettle <i>Catheretes Urtic√¶</i>, to the
toad-flax <i>Catheretes gravidus</i>, both minute beetles, &amp;c.
Whether the operations of <i>Cynips Psenes</i> be of that
advantage in fertilizing the fig, which the cultivators of
that fruit in the East have long supposed, is doubted by
Hasselquist and Olivier<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>, both competent observers, who
have been on the spot. Our own gardeners, however,
will admit their obligations to bees in <i>setting</i> their cucumbers
and melons, to which they find the necessity of themselves
conveying pollen from a male flower, when the
early season of the year precludes the assistance of insects.
Sprengel asserts, that apparently with a view to
prevent hybrid mixtures, insects which derive their honey
or pollen from different plants indiscriminately, will
during a whole day confine their visits to that species on
which they first fixed in the morning, provided there be
a sufficient supply of it<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>; and the same observation was
long since made with respect to bees by our countryman
Dobbs<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the flowers which we vainly think are</p>

<p>though unvisited by the lord of the creation, who boasts
that they were made for him, have nevertheless myriads

their sweets, contribute to their fertility.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_X" id="LETTER_X">LETTER X.</a></h2>

<h3><i>BENEFITS DERIVED FROM INSECTS.</i></h3>

<h5>DIRECT BENEFITS.</h5>


<p>My last letter was devoted to the indirect advantages
which we derive from insects; in the present I shall
enumerate those of a more <i>direct</i> nature for which we
are indebted to them, beginning with their use as the
<i>food</i> of man, in which respect they are of more importance
than you may have conceived.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One class of animals which, till very lately, have been
regarded as belonging to the entomological world, I
mean the <i>Crustacea</i>, consisting principally of the genus
<i>Cancer</i> of Linn√©, are universally reckoned amongst our
greatest dainties; and they who would turn with disgust
from a locust or the grub of a beetle, feel no symptoms
of nausea when a lobster, crab, or shrimp is set before
them. The fact is, that habit has reconciled us to the
eating of these last, which, viewed in themselves with
their threatening claws and many feet, are really more
disgusting than the former. Had the habit been reversed,
we should have viewed the former with appetite and
the latter with abhorrence, as do the Arabs, "who are
as much astonished at our eating crabs, lobsters, and
oysters, as we are at their eating locusts<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>." That this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
would have been the case is clear, at least as far as regards
the former position, from the practice in other
parts of the world, both in ancient and modern times, to
which, begging you to lay aside your English prejudices,
I shall now call your attention; first observing by the
way, that the insects used as food, generally speaking,
live on vegetable substances, and are consequently much
more select and cleanly in their diet than the swine or
the duck, which form a favourite part of ours.</p>

<p>Many larv√¶<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> that belong to the order <i>Coleoptera</i> are
eaten in different parts of the world. The grub of the
palm-weevil (<i>Cordylia</i><a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> <i>Palmarum</i>), which is the size of
the thumb, has been long in request in both the Indies.
√Ülian speaks of an Indian king, who, for a dessert, instead
of fruit set before his Grecian guests a roasted
worm taken from a plant, probably the larva of this insect,
which he says the Indians esteem very delicious&mdash;a
character that was confirmed by some of the Greeks
who tasted it<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>. Madam Merian has figured one of these
larv√¶, and says that the natives of Surinam roast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
eat them as something very exquisite<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>. A friend of
mine, who has resided a good deal in the West Indies,
where the palm-grub is called <i>Grugru</i>, informs me that
the late Sir John La Forey, who was somewhat of an epicure,
was extremely fond of it when properly cooked.</p>

<p>The larv√¶ also of the larger species of the capricorn
tribe (<i>Cerambyx</i>, L. <i>Longicornes</i>, Latr.) are accounted
very great delicacies in many countries; and the Cossus
of Pliny, which he tells us the Roman epicures fattened
with flour<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>, most probably belonged to this tribe. Linn√©
indeed, following the opinion of Ray<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>, supposes the caterpillar
of the great goat-moth, the anatomy of which
has been so wonderfully traced by the eye and pencil
of the incomparable Lyonet, to be the Cossus. But there
seems a strong reason against this opinion; for Linn√©'s
Cossus lives most commonly in the willow, Pliny's in
the oak; and the former is a very disagreeable, ugly and
fetid larva, not very likely to attract the Roman epicures.
Probably they were the larv√¶ of <i>Prionus coriarius</i>,
which I have myself extracted from the oak, or of
one of its congeners<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>. The grub of <i>P. damicornis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
which is of the thickness of a man's finger, is eaten at
Surinam, in America, and in the West Indies, both by
whites and blacks, who empty, wash, and roast them,
and find them delicious<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>. Mr. Hall informs me, that
in Jamaica this grub is called <i>Macauco</i>, and is in request
at the principal tables. A similar insect is dressed at
Mauritius under the name of <i>Moutac</i>, which the whites
as well as Negroes eat greedily<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>. The larva of <i>P. cervicornis</i>
is, according to Linn√©, held in equal estimation,
and that of <i>Acanthocinus Tribulus</i> when roasted forms
an article of food in Africa<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>. It is probable that all the
species of this genus might be safely eaten, as well as
many other grubs of <i>Coleoptera</i>; and although I do not
feel disposed to recommend with Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>, that the
larv√¶ of <i>Oryctes nasicornis</i> should be sought for "<i>dans
les couches de fumier</i>," yet I think with Dr. Darwin<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>,
that those of the cockchafer which feed upon the roots of
grass, or the perfect insects themselves, which, if we may
judge from the eagerness with which cats, and turkeys
and other birds devour them, are no despicable <i>bonne
bouche</i>, might be added to our <i>entremets</i>. This would
be one means of keeping down the numbers of these
occasionally destructive animals.</p>

<p>In the next order of insects, the <i>Orthoptera</i>, the gryllus,
or locust tribe, as they are the greatest destroyers
of food, so as some recompense they furnish a considerable
supply of it to numerous nations. They are recorded
to have done this from the most remote antiquity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
some Ethiopian tribes having been named from this circumstance
<i>Acridophagi</i> (locust-eaters)<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>. Pliny also relates
that they were in high esteem as meat amongst the
Parthians<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>. Hasselquist, in reply to some inquiries
which he made on this subject with respect to the Arabs,
was informed that at Mecca, when there was a scarcity
of corn, as a substitute for flour they would grind locusts
in their hand-mills, or pound them in stone mortars;
that they mixed this flour with water into a dough, and
made their cakes of it, which they baked like their other
bread. He adds, that it is not unusual for them to eat
locusts when there is no famine; but then they boil
them first a good while in water, and afterwards stew
them with butter into a kind of fricassee of no bad flavour<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>.
Leo Africanus, as quoted by Bochart, gives a
similar account<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>. Sparrman informs us that the Hottentots
are highly rejoiced at the arrival of the locusts in
their country, although they destroy all its verdure, eating
them in such quantities as to get visibly fatter than
before, and making of their eggs a brown or coffee-coloured
soup. He also relates a curious notion which
they have with respect to the origin of the locusts&mdash;that
they proceed from the good will of a great master-conjuror
a long way to the north, who, having removed the
stone from the mouth of a certain deep pit, lets loose
these animals to be food for them<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>. This is not unlike
the account given by the author of the Apocalypse, of the
origin of the symbolical locusts, which are said to ascend
upon an angel's opening the pit of the abyss<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>. Clenard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
in his letters quoted by Bochart, says that they bring
waggon-loads of locusts to Fez, as a usual article of food<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>.
Major Moor informs me, that when the cloud of locusts
noticed in a former letter visited the Mahratta country,
the common people salted and ate them. This was anciently
the custom with many of the African nations,
some of whom also smoked them<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>. They appear even
to have been an article of food offered for sale in the
markets of Greece<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>; and on a subject so well known, to
quote no other writers, Jackson observes that, when he
was in Barbary in 1799, dishes of locusts were generally
served up at the principal tables and esteemed a great
delicacy. They are preferred by the Moors to pigeons;
and a person may eat a platefull of two or three hundred
without feeling any ill effects. They usually boil them
in water half an hour, (having thrown away the head,
wings and legs,) then sprinkle them with salt and pepper,
and fry them, adding a little vinegar<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>.&mdash;From this
string of authorities you will readily see how idle was
the controversy concerning the locusts which formed
part of the sustenance of John the Baptist, agreeing with
Hasselquist<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>, that they could be nothing but the animal
locust, so common a food in the East; and how apt even
learned men are to perplex a plain question, from ignorance
of the customs of other countries.</p>

<p>In the <i>hemipterous</i> order of insects, none are more
widely dispersed, or (if you will forgive me a pun) have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
made more noise in the world, than the <i>Cicada</i> tribe.
From the time of Homer, who compares the garrulity
of age to the chirping of these insects<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>, they have been
celebrated by the poets; and Anacreon, as you well
know, has inscribed a very beautiful little ode to them.
We learn from Aristotle, that these insects were eaten
by the polished Greeks, and accounted very delicious.
The worm (<i>larva</i>), he says, lives in the earth where it
takes its growth; that it then becomes a <i>Tettigometra</i>
(<i>pupa</i>), when he observes they are most delicious, just
before they burst from their covering. From this state
they change to the <i>Tettix</i> or <i>Cicada</i>, when the males at
first have the best flavour; but after impregnation the
females are preferred on account of their white eggs<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>.
Athen√¶us also and Aristophanes mention their being
eaten; and √Ülian is extremely angry with the men of
his age that an animal sacred to the Muses should be
strung, sold, and greedily devoured<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>. Pliny tells us
that the nations of the East, even the Parthians, whose
wealth was abundant, use them as food<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>. The imago of
the <i>Cicada septemdecim</i> is still eaten by the Indians in
America, who pluck off the wings and boil them<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>. This
ancient Greek taste for <i>Cicad√¶</i> seems now gone out of
fashion, at least travellers do not notice it: but perhaps
if it were revived in those countries where the insects
are to be found, for they inhabit only warm climates<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>,
it would be ascertained that so polished a people did not
relish them without reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>No insects are more numerous in this island than the
caterpillars of <i>Lepidoptera</i>: if these could be used in aid
of the stock of food in times of scarcity, it might subserve
the double purpose of ridding us of a nuisance, and relieving
the public pressure. Reaumur suggests this mode
of diminishing the numbers of destructive caterpillars,
speaking of that of <i>Plusia Gamma</i>, a moth which did
such infinite mischief in France in the year 1735<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>. If
however we were to take to eating caterpillars, I should,
for my own part, be of the mind of the red-breasts, and
eat only the naked ones<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>. But you will see that there
is some encouragement from precedent to make a meal
of the caterpillars which infest our cabbages and cauliflowers.
Amongst the delicacies of a Boshies-man's
table, Sparrman reckons those caterpillars from which
butterflies proceed<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>. The Chinese, who waste nothing,
after they have unwound the silk from the cocoons of
the silkworm, send the chrysalis to table: they also eat
the larva of a hawk-moth (<i>Sphinx</i><a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>), some of which tribe,
Dr. Darwin tells us, are, in his opinion, very delicious<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>:
and lastly, the natives of New Holland eat the caterpillars
of a species of moth of a singular new genus, to which
my friend Alexander MacLeay, Esq., has assigned characters,
and, from the circumstance of its larva coming
out only in the night to feed, has called it <i>Nycterobius</i>.</p>

<p>The next order, the <i>Neuroptera</i>, will make us some
amends for the meagerness of the last, as it contains the
white ant tribe (<i>Termes</i>), which, in return for the mischief
it does at certain times, affords an abundant supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
of food to some of the African nations. The Hottentots
eat them boiled and raw, and soon get into good condition
upon this food<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>. K√∂nig, quoted by Smeathman, says
that in some parts of the East Indies the natives make
two holes in the nests of the white ants, one to the windward
and the other to the leeward, placing at the latter
opening a pot rubbed with an aromatic herb, to receive
the insects driven out of their nest by a fire of stinking
materials made at the former<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>. Thus they catch great
quantities, of which they make with flour a variety of
pastry, that they can afford to sell cheap to the poorer
people. Mr. Smeathman says he has not found the
Africans so ingenious in procuring or dressing them.
They are content with a very small part of those that
fall into the waters at the time of swarming, which they
skim off with calabashes, bring large kettles full of them
to their habitations, and parch them in iron pots over a
gentle fire, stirring them about as is done in roasting
coffee. In that state without sauce or other addition
they serve them up as delicious food, and eat them by
handfulls as we do comfits. He has eaten them dressed
in this way several times, and thought them delicate,
nourishing and wholesome, being sweeter than the grub
of the weevil of the palms, (<i>Cordylia Palmarum</i>,) and
resembling in taste sugared cream or sweet almond
paste<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>. The female ant, in particular, is supposed by
the Hindoos to be endowed with highly nutritive properties,
and, we are told by Mr. Broughton, was carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
sought after and preserved for the use of the debilitated
Surjee Rao, prime-minister of Scindia chief of the
Mahrattas<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hymenoptera</i> order also furnishes a few articles
to add to this head. I do not allude to the nectar which
the bees collect for us. But perhaps you do not suspect
that bees themselves in some places serve for food, yet
Knox tells us that they are eaten in Ceylon<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>:&mdash;an ungrateful
return for their honey and wax which I would
on no account recommend. Piso speaks of yellow ants
called <i>Cupi√°</i> inhabiting Brazil, the abdomen of which
many used for food, as well as a larger species under
the name of <i>Tama-joura</i><a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>; which account is confirmed
by Humboldt, who informs us that ants are eaten by the
Marivatanos and Margueritares, mixed with resin for
sauce. Ants, I speak from experience, have no unpleasant
flavour; they are very agreeably acid, and the taste
of the trunk and abdomen is different; so that I am not
so much surprised as Mr. Consett seems to have been
at the avidity with which the young Swede mentioned by
him sat down to the siege of an ants' nest<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>. This author
states, that in some parts of Sweden ants are distilled
along with rye, to give a flavour to the inferior kinds of
brandy<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>.&mdash;Under this head may not improperly be mentioned
several galls the product of different species of gall-flies
(<i>Cynips</i>), particularly those found on some kind of
Sage, viz. <i>Salvia pomifera</i>, <i>S. triloba</i>, and <i>S. officinalis</i>,
which are very juicy like apples, and crowned with rudiments
of leaves resembling the calyx of that fruit. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
are esteemed in the Levant for their aromatic and acid
flavour, especially when prepared with sugar, and form
a considerable article of commerce from Scio to Constantinople,
where they are regularly exposed in the
market<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>. The galls of ground-ivy have also been eaten
in France; but Reaumur, who tasted them, is doubtful
whether they will ever rank with good fruits<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>.</p>

<p>To the <i>Diptera</i> order, as a source of food, man can
scarcely be said to be under any obligation; the larva of
<i>Tyrophaga Casei</i>, which is so commonly found in cheese,
being the only one ever eaten&mdash;a dainty as some think
it, of whom you will perhaps say with Scopoli, "<i>quibus
has delicias non invideo</i><a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>."</p>

<p>The order <i>Aptera</i>, now that the Crustacea are excluded,
does not much more abound in esculent insects
than the Diptera. The only species which have tempted
the appetite of man in this order are the cheese-mite
(<i>Acarus Siro</i>)&mdash;lice, which are eaten by the Hottentots
and natives of the western coast of Africa, who from
their love of this game, which they not only collect themselves
from their well stored <i>capital</i> pasture, but employ
their wives in the chase, have been sometimes called
Phthirophagi<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>. Insects of the class <i>Arachnida</i>, which
you will think still more repulsive than the last tribe,
form an article in Sparrman's list of the Boshies-man's
dainties<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>; and Labillardiere tells us that the inhabitants
of New Caledonia seek for and eat with avidity large
quantities of a spider nearly an inch long (which he calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
<i>Aranea edulis</i>), and which they roast over the fire<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.
Even individuals amongst the more polished nations of
Europe are recorded as having a similar taste; so that,
if you could rise above vulgar prejudices, you would in
all probability find them a most delicious morsel. If
you require precedents, Reaumur tells us of a young
lady who when she walked in her grounds never saw a
spider that she did not take and crack upon the spot<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>.
Another female, the celebrated Anna Maria Schurman,
used to eat them like nuts, which she affirmed they much
resembled in taste, excusing her propensity by saying
that she was born under the sign Scorpio<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>. If you wish
for the authority of the learned, Lalande the celebrated
French astronomer was, as Latreille witnessed<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>, equally
fond of these delicacies. And lastly, if not content with
taking them seriatim you should feel desirous of eating
them by handfulls, you may shelter yourself under the
authority of the German immortalized by R√∂sel<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>, who
used to spread them upon his bread like butter, observing
that he found them very useful, "<i>um sich auszulaxiren</i>."&mdash;These
edible <i>Aptera</i> and <i>Arachnida</i> are all sufficiently
disgusting: but we feel our nausea quite turned into
horror when we read in Humboldt, that he has seen the
Indian children drag out of the earth centipedes eighteen
inches long and more than half an inch broad, and devour
them<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>.</p>

<p>After all I have said, you may perhaps still feel a prejudice
against insects as food; but I think, when you recollect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
that Oberon and his queen Titania, that renowned
personage Robin Goodfellow, "with all the fairy elves
that be," number insects amongst their choicest cates,
you will no longer be heretical in this article, but yield
with a good grace; and as a reward I will copy out for
you a beautiful poetical description of Oberon's feast,
which was lately pointed out to me by a learned bibliographical
friend, John Crosse, Esq. of Hull, in Herrick's
<i>Hesperides</i>, 1658.</p>

<p>Having considered insects as adding to the general
stock of food, I shall next request your attention while I
detail to you how far the medical science is indebted to
them. Had I addressed you a century ago, I could have
made this an ample history. Amongst scores of infallible
panaceas, I should have recommended the woodlouse
as a solvent and aperient; powder of silkworm for vertigo
and convulsions; millepedes against the jaundice;
earwigs to strengthen the nerves; powdered scorpion for
the stone and gravel; fly-water for disorders in the eyes;
and the tick for erysipelas. I should have prescribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
five gnats as an excellent purge; wasps as diuretics;
lady-birds for the colic and measles; the cockchafer for
the bite of a mad dog and the plague; and ants and their
acid I should have loudly praised as incomparable against
leprosy and deafness, as strengthening the memory, and
giving vigour and animation to the whole bodily frame<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>.
In short, I could have easily added to the miserably
meager list of modern pharmacop&#339;ias, a catalogue of
approved insect-remedies for every disease and evil</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"that flesh is heir to!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But these good times are long gone by. You would, I
fear, laugh at my prescriptions notwithstanding the great
authorities I could cite in their favour; and even doubt
the efficacy of a more modern specific for tooth-ache,
promulgated by a learned Italian professor<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>, who assures
us that a finger once imbued with the juices of <i>Rhinobatus
antiodontalgicus</i> (a name enough to give one the
tooth-ache to pronounce it) will retain its power of curing
this disease for a twelvemonth! I must content myself,
therefore, with expatiating on the virtues of the very few
insects to which the sons of Hippocrates and Galen now
deign to have recourse. At the same time I cannot help
observing that their proscription of the remainder may
have been too indiscriminate. Mankind are apt to run
from one extreme to the other. From having ascribed
too much efficacy to insect-remedies, we may now ascribe
too little. Many insects emit very powerful odours,
and some produce extraordinary effects upon the human
frame; and it is an idea not altogether to be rejected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that they may concentrate into a smaller compass the
properties and virtues of the plants upon which they
feed, and thus afford medicines more powerful in operation
than the plants themselves. It is at least worth
while to institute a set of experiments with this view.</p>

<p>Medicine at the present day is indebted to an ant
(<i>Formica bispinosa</i>, Oliv. <i>fungosa</i>, F.) for a kind of lint
collected by that insect from the Bombax or silk cotton-tree,
which as a styptic is preferable to the puff-ball, and
at Cayenne is successfully used to stop the blood in the
most violent h√¶morrhages<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>; and gum ammoniac, according
to Mr. Jackson<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>, oozes out of a plant like fennel,
from incisions made in the bark by a beetle with a
large horn. But with these exceptions, (in which the
remedy is rather collected than produced by insects,) and
that of spiders' webs, which are said to have been recently
administered with success in ague, the only insects
which directly supply us with medicine are some species
of <i>Cantharis</i> and <i>Mylabris</i>. These beetles however
amply make up in efficacy for their numerical insignificance;
and almost any article could be better spared
from the Materia Medica than one of the former usually
known under the name of <i>Cantharides</i>, which is not only
of incalculable importance as a vesicatory, but is now
administered internally in many cases with very good effect.
In Europe, the only insect used with this view is
the <i>Cantharis vesicatoria</i>; but in America the <i>C. cinerea</i>
and <i>vittata</i> (which are extremely common and noxious
insects, while the <i>C. vesicatoria</i> is sold there at sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
dollars the pound,) have been substituted with great
success, and are said to vesicate more speedily, and with
less pain, at the same time that they cause no strangury<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>:
and in China they have long employed the <i>Mylabris Cichorei</i>,
which seems to have been considered the most
powerful vesicatory amongst the ancients, who however
appear to have been acquainted with the common <i>Cantharis
vesicatoria</i> also, and to have made use of it, as well
as of <i>Cetonia aurata</i> and some other insects mentioned by
Pliny<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>. Another species of <i>Mylabris</i> has been described
by Major-general Hardwicke in the <i>Asiatic Transactions</i><a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>,
plentiful in all parts of Bengal, Bahar, and Oude,
which is fully as efficacious as the common Spanish fly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it is as supplying products valuable in the arts
and manufactures, that we are chiefly indebted to insects.
In adverting to them in this view, I shall not
dwell upon the articles derived from a few species in particular
districts, and confined to these alone, such as the
soap which in some parts of Africa is manufactured from
a beetle (<i>Chl√¶nius saponarius</i><a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>); the oil which Molina
tells us is obtained in Chili from large globular cellules
found upon the wild rosemary, and supposed to be produced
by a kind of gall-fly<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>; and the manure for which
Scopoli informs us the hosts of Ephemer√¶ that annually
emerge in the month of June from the Laz, a river in
Carniola, are employed by the husbandmen, who think
they have had a bad harvest unless every one has collected
at least twenty loads<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.</p>

<p>Still less is it my intention to detain you in considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
the purpose to which in the West Indies and South
America the fire-flies are put by the natives, who employ
them as lanterns in their journeys, and lamps in their
houses<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>;&mdash;or the use as ornaments to which some insects
are ingeniously applied by the ladies, who in China embroider
their dresses with the elytra and crust of a brilliant
species of beetle (<i>Buprestis vittata</i>); in Chili and
the Brazils form splendid necklaces of the golden <i>Chrysomelid√¶</i>
and brilliant diamond beetles, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>; in some
parts of the continent string together for the same purpose
the burnished violet-coloured thighs of <i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>; and in India, as I am informed by
Major Moor and Captain Green, even have recourse to
fire-flies, which they inclose in gauze and use as ornaments
for their hair when they take their evening walks.
I shall confine my details to the more important and
general products which they supply to the arts, beginning
with one indispensable to our present correspondence,
and adverting in succession to the insects affording
<i>dyes</i>, <i>lac</i>, <i>wax</i>, <i>honey</i>, and <i>silk</i>.</p>

<p>No present that insects have made to the arts is equal
in utility and universal interest, comes more home to
our best affections, or is the instrument of producing
more valuable fruits of human wisdom and genius, than
the product of the animal to which I have just alluded.
You will readily conjecture I mean the fly that gives birth
to the <i>gall-nut</i>, from which ink is made,&mdash;How infinitely
are we indebted to this little creature, which at once
enables us to converse with our absent friends and connexions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
be their distance from us ever so great, and supplies
the means by which, to use the poet's language we
can</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"&mdash;&mdash;give to airy nothing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A local habitation and a name!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>enabling the poet, the philosopher, the politician, the
moralist, and the divine, to embody their thoughts for
the amusement, instruction, direction and reformation of
mankind.&mdash;The insect which produces the gall-nut is of
the genus <i>Cynips</i> of Linn√©, but was not known to him
or to Fabricius. Olivier first described it under the
name of <i>Diplolepis gall√¶ tinctori√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>. The galls originate
on the leaves of a species of oak (<i>Quercus infectoria</i>,)
very common throughout Asia Minor, in many parts of
which they are collected by the poorer inhabitants and
exported from Smyrna, Aleppo, and other ports in the
Levant, as well as from the East Indies, whither a part
of those collected are now carried. The galls most esteemed
are those known in commerce under the name of
<i>blue galls</i>, being the produce of the first gathering before
the fly has issued from the gall. It will not be uninteresting
to you to know, that from these when bruised
may occasionally be obtained perfect specimens of the
insect, one of which I lately procured in this way. The
galls which have escaped the first searches, and from
most of which the fly has emerged, are called <i>white galls</i>,
and are of a very inferior quality, containing less of the
astringent principle than the blue galls in the proportion
of two to three<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>. The white and blue galls are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
imported mixed in about equal proportions, and are then
called galls in sorts. If no substitute equal to galls as
a constituent part of ink has been discovered, the same
may be said of these productions as one of the most
important of our dyeing materials constantly employed
in dyeing black. It is true that this colour may be communicated
without galls, but not at once so cheaply and
effectually, as is found by their continued large consumption
notwithstanding all the improvements in the art of
dyeing. Other dyeing drugs are afforded by insects, the
principal of which are <i>Chermes</i>, <i>the Scarlet Grain of Poland</i>,
<i>Cochineal</i>, <i>Lac-lake</i>, and <i>Lac-dye</i>, all of which are
furnished by different species of <i>Coccus</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these, the <i>Coccus Ilicis</i>, found abundantly
upon a small species of evergreen oak (<i>Quercus coccifera</i>)
common in the south of France, and many other parts
of the world, has been employed to impart a blood
red or crimson dye to cloth from the earliest ages, and
was known to the Ph&#339;nicians before the time of Moses
under the name of <i>Tola</i> or <i>Thola</i> (&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514;), to the Greeks
under that of <i>Coccus</i> (&#922;&#959;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#962;), and to the Arabians and
Persians under that of <i>Kermes</i> or <i>Alkermes</i>; whence, as
Beckmann has shown, and from the epithet <i>vermiculatum</i>
given to it in the middle ages, when it was ascertained
to be the produce of a worm, have sprung the Latin <i>coccineus</i>,
the French <i>cramoisi</i> and <i>vermeil</i>, and our <i>crimson</i>
and <i>vermilion</i>. It was most probably with this substance
that the curtains of the tabernacle (Exod. xxvi. &amp;c.) were
dyed deep red (which the word scarlet, as our translators
have rendered &#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;&#1514; &#1513;&#1504;&#1497;, then implied, not the colour
now so called, which was not known in James the First's
reign when the Bible was translated)&mdash;it was with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
that the Grecians and Romans produced their crimson;
and from the same source were derived the imperishable
reds of the Brussels and other Flemish tapestries. In
short, previous to the discovery of cochineal, this was the
material universally used for dyeing the most brilliant
red then known; and though that production of the New
World has, in some respects undeservedly<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>, supplanted
it in Europe, where it is little attended to except by the
peasantry of the provinces in which it is found, it still
continues to be employed in a great part of India and
Persia<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.</p>

<p>The scarlet grain of Poland (<i>Coccus polonicus</i>) is found
on the roots of the perennial knawel (<i>Scleranthus perennis</i>,
a scarce plant in this country, but abundant in
the neighbourhood of Elvedon in Suffolk), and was at
one time collected in large quantities for dyeing red in
the Ukraine, Lithuania, &amp;c. But though still employed
by the Turks and Armenians for dyeing wool, silk and
hair, as well as for staining the nails of women's fingers,
it is now rarely used in Europe except by the Polish
peasantry. A similar neglect has attended the Coccus
found on the roots of <i>Poterium Sanguisorba</i><a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>, which was
used by the Moors for dyeing silk and wool a rose colour;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
and the <i>Coccus Uva-ursi</i>, which with alum affords
a crimson dye<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>.</p>

<p>Cochineal, the <i>Coccus Cacti</i>, is doubtless the most valuable
product for which the dyer is indebted to insects,
and with the exception perhaps of indigo the most important
of dyeing materials. Though the Spaniards
found it employed by the natives of Mexico, where alone
it is cultivated, on their arrival in that country in 1518,
its true nature was not accurately ascertained for nearly
two centuries afterwards. Acosta indeed as early as 1530,
and Herrara and Hernandez subsequently, had stated
it to be an insect. But led apparently by its external
appearance, notwithstanding the conjectures of Lister
and assertions of Pere Plumier to the contrary, it was
believed by Europeans in general to be the seed of a
plant, until Hartsoeker in 1694, Leeuwenhoek and De
la Hire in 1704, and Geoffroy, ten years later, by dissections
and microscopical observations incontrovertibly
proved its real origin<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.</p>

<p>This insect, which comes to us in the form of a reddish
shrivelled grain covered with a white powder or
bloom, feeds on a particular kind of Indian fig, called in
Mexico, where alone cochineal is produced in any quantity,
Nopal, which has always been supposed to be the
<i>Cactus cochinilifer</i>, but according to Humboldt is unquestionably
a distinct species, which bears fruit internally
white.</p>

<p>Cochineal is chiefly cultivated in the Intendency of
Oaxaca; and some plantations contain 50 or 60,000 nopals
in lines, each being kept about four feet high for
more easy access in collecting the dye. The cultivators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
prefer the most prickly varieties of the plant, as affording
protection to the cochineal from insects; to prevent
which from depositing their eggs in the flower or fruit,
both are carefully cut off. The greatest quantity, however,
of cochineal employed in commerce, is produced
in small nopaleries belonging to Indians of extreme poverty,
called <i>Nopaleros</i>. They plant their nopaleries in
cleared ground on the slopes of mountains or ravines
two or three leagues distant from their villages; and when
properly cleaned, the plants are in a condition to maintain
the cochineal in the third year. As a stock, the
proprietor in April or May purchases branches or joints
of the <i>Tuna de Castilla</i>, laden with small cochineal insects
recently hatched (<i>Semilla</i>). These branches, which
may be bought in the market of Oaxaca for about three
francs (2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) the hundred, are kept for twenty days in
the interior of their huts, and then exposed to the open
air under a shed, where from their succulency they continue
to live for several months. In August and September
the mother cochineal insects, now big with young,
are placed in nests made of a species of <i>Tillandsia</i> called
<i>Paxtle</i>, which are distributed upon the nopals. In about
four months the first gathering, yielding twelve for one,
may be made, which in the course of the year is succeeded
by two more profitable harvests. This period of
sowing and harvest refers chiefly to the districts of Sola
and Zimatlan. In colder climates the semilla is not
placed upon the nopals until October or even December,
when it is necessary to shelter the young insects by covering
the nopals with rush mats, and the harvests are
proportionably later and unproductive. In the immediate
vicinity of the town of Oaxaca the Nopaleros feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
their cochineal insects in the plains from October to
April, and at the beginning of the remaining months,
during which it rains in the plains, transport them to
their plantations of nopals in the neighbouring mountains,
where the weather is more favourable.</p>

<p>Much care is necessary in the tedious operation of
gathering the cochineal from the nopals, which is performed
with a squirrel or stag's tail by the Indian women,
who for this purpose squat down for hours together beside
one plant; and notwithstanding the high price of the
cochineal, it is to be doubted if the cultivation would be
profitable were the value of labour more considerable.</p>

<p>The cochineal insects are killed either by throwing
them into boiling water; by exposing them in heaps to
the sun; or by placing them in the ovens (<i>Temazealli</i>)
used for vapour baths. The last of these methods, which
is least in use, preserves the whitish powder on the body
of the cochineal, which being thus less subject to the
adulterations so often practised by the Indians, bears a
higher price both in America and Europe<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>.</p>

<p>The quantity at present annually exported from South
America is said by Humboldt to be 32,000 arrobas,
there worth 500,040<i>l.</i> sterling<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>&mdash;a vast amount to arise
from so small an insect, and well calculated to show us
the absurdity of despising any animals on account of
their minuteness. So important is the acquisition of
this insect (of which the Spanish government is extremely
jealous) regarded, that the Court of Directors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
the East India Company have offered a reward of 6000<i>l.</i>
to any one who shall introduce it into India, where hitherto
the Company have only succeeded in procuring
from Brazil the wild kind producing the <i>sylvestre</i> cochineal,
which is of very inferior value.</p>

<p><i>Lac</i>, is the produce of an insect formerly supposed to
be a kind of ant or bee<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>, but now ascertained to be a
species of <i>Coccus</i>, whose history will be adverted to
when I come to speak of the secretions of insects; and
it is collected from various trees in India, where it is
found so abundantly, that, were the consumption ten
times greater than it is, it could be readily supplied.
This substance is made use of in that country in the manufacture
of beads, rings, and other female ornaments.
Mixed with sand it forms grind-stones; and added to
lamp- or ivory-black, being first dissolved in water with
the addition of a little borax, it composes an ink not
easily acted upon when dry by damp or water. In this
country, where it is distinguished by the names <i>stick-lac</i>
when in its native state unseparated from the twigs to
which it adheres; <i>seed-lac</i> when separated, pounded, and
the greater part of the colouring matter extracted by
water; <i>lump-lac</i> when melted and made into cakes; and
<i>shell-lac</i> when strained and formed into transparent lamin√¶;&mdash;it
has hitherto been chiefly employed in the
composition of varnishes, japanned ware, and sealing-wax:
but within these few years it has been applied to
a still more important purpose, originally suggested by
Dr. Roxburgh&mdash;that of a substitute for cochineal in dyeing
scarlet. The first preparations from it with this view
were made in consequence of a hint from Dr. Bancroft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
and large quantities of a substance termed <i>lac-lake</i>, consisting
of the colouring matter of stick-lac precipitated
from an alkaline lixivium by alum, were manufactured
at Calcutta and sent to this country, where at first the
consumption was so considerable, that in the three years
previous to 1810 Dr. Bancroft states that the sales of it
at the India House equalled in point of colouring matter
half a million of pounds weight of cochineal. More recently,
however, a new preparation of lac colour, under
the name of <i>lac-dye</i>, has been imported from India, which
has been substituted for the lac-lake, and with such advantage,
that the East India Company are said to have
saved in a few months 14,000<i>l.</i> in the purchase of scarlet
cloths dyed with this colour and cochineal conjointly,
and without any inferiority in the colour obtained<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>.</p>

<p>Some other insects besides the Cocci afford dyes. Reaumur
tells us, that in the Levant, Persia, and China, they
use the galls of a particular species of <i>Aphis</i> for dyeing
silk crimson, which he thinks might lead us to try experiments
with those of our own country<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>. That dyes
might be thus obtained seems probable from an observation
of Linn√©'s, in his Lapland Tour, upon the galls
produced by <i>Aphis Pini</i> on the extremities of the leaves
of the spruce-fir, which, he informs us, when arrived at
maturity burst asunder, and discharge an orange-coloured
powder which stains the clothes<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>; and Mr. Sheppard
confirms this observation, the galls of this Aphis
abounding upon fir-trees in his garden. In fact, we are
told that <i>Terminalia citrina</i>, a tree common in India,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
yields a species of gall, the product of an insect, which
is sold in every market, being one of the most useful
dyeing drugs known to the natives, who dye their best
and most durable yellow with it<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>. A species of mite
(<i>Trombidium tinctorium</i>), a native of Guinea and Surinam,
is also employed as a dye; and it would be worth
while to try whether our <i>T. holosericeum</i>, so remarkable
for the dazzling brilliancy of its crimson and the beautiful
velvet texture of its down, which seems nearly related
to <i>T. tinctorium</i>, would not also afford a valuable
tincture. It is not likely, perhaps, that many better and
cheaper dyes than we now possess can be obtained from
insects; but Reaumur has suggested that water-colours of
beautiful tints, not otherwise easily obtainable, might be
procured from the excrements of the larv√¶ of the common
clothes-moth, which retain the colour of the wool
they have eaten unimpaired in its lustre, and mix very
well with water. To get a fine red, yellow, blue, green,
or any other colour or shade of colour, we should merely
have to feed our larv√¶ with cloth of that tint<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Wax</i>, so valuable for many minor purposes, and deemed
with us so indispensable to the comfort of the great,
is of still more importance in those parts of Europe and
America in which it forms a considerable branch of
trade and manufacture, as an article of extensive use in
the religious ceremonies of the inhabitants. Humboldt
informs us, that not fewer than 25,000 arrobas, value upwards
of 83,000<i>l.</i>, are annually exported from Cuba to
New Spain, where the quantity consumed in the festivals
of the Church is immense even in the smallest villages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
and that the total export of the same island in 1803 was
not less than 42,670 arrobas, worth upwards of 130,000<i>l.</i><a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
Nearly the whole of the wax employed in Europe, and
by far the greater part of that consumed in America, is
the produce of the common hive-bee; but in the latter
quarter of the globe a quantity by no means trifling is
obtained from various wild species. According to Don
F. de Azara, the inhabitants of Santiago del Estero gather
every year not less than 14,000 pounds of a whitish
wax from the trees of Chaco<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>.</p>

<p>In China wax is also produced by another insect,
which from the description of it by the Abb√© Grosier
seems to be a species of <i>Coccus</i>. With this insect the
Chinese stock the two kinds of tree (<i>Kan-la-chu</i> and
<i>Choni-la-chu</i>) on which alone it is found, and which always
afterwards retain it. Towards the beginning of
winter small tumours are perceived, which increase until
as big as a walnut. These are the nests (abdomens of
the females) filled with the eggs that are to give birth to
the <i>Cocci</i>, which when hatched disperse themselves over
the leaves, and perforate the bark under which they retire.
The wax (called <i>Pe-la</i>, white wax, because so by
nature,) begins to appear about the middle of June. At
first a few filaments like fine soft wool are perceived,
rising from the bark round the body of the insect, and
these increase more and more until the gathering, which
takes place before the first hoar frosts in September.
The wax is carried to court, and reserved for the emperor,
the princes, and chief mandarins. If an ounce of
it be added to a pound of oil, it forms a wax little inferior
to that made by bees. The physicians employ it in
several diseases; and the Chinese, when about to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
in public and assurance is necessary, previously eat an
ounce of it to prevent swoonings<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>; a use of it for which
happily our less diffident orators have no call. This
account is in the main confirmed by Geomelli Careri,
except that he calls the wax-insect a <i>worm</i> which bores
to the pith of certain trees; and says that it produces a
sufficient supply for the whole empire, the different provinces
of which are furnished from Xantung, where it is
bred in the greatest perfection, with a stock of eggs<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>.
A very different origin, however, is assigned to the <i>Pe-la</i>
by Sir George Staunton, who informs us that it is produced
by a species of Cicada (<i>Flata limbata</i>), which in
its larva state feeds upon a plant like the privet, strewing
upon the stem a powder, which when collected forms
the wax<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>. But as he merely states that this powder was
"<i>supposed</i>" to form it, and does not himself appear to
have made the experiment of dissolving it in oil, it is
most probable that his information was incorrect, and
that Grosier's statement is the true one.</p>

<p>This probability is nearly converted into certainty by
the fact that many Aphides and Cocci secrete a wax-like
substance, and that a kind of wax very analogous to the
<i>Pe-la</i>, and of the same class with bees-wax, only containing
more carbon, is actually produced in India by a
nondescript species of Coccus remarkable for providing
itself with a small quantity of honey like our bees. This
substance, for specimens of which I am indebted to the
kindness of Sir Joseph Banks, was first noticed by
Dr. Anderson, and called by him <i>white-lac</i>. It could be obtained
in any quantity from the neighbourhood of Madras,
and at a much cheaper rate than bees-wax: but the experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of Dr. Pearson do not afford much ground
for supposing that it can be advantageously employed in
making candles<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>. De Azara speaks of a firm white wax
apparently similar, and the produce of an insect of the
same tribe, which is collected in South America in the
form of pearl-like globules from the small branches of
the <i>Quabir√¢m√Ω</i>, a small shrub two or three feet high<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.</p>

<p>Insects in some countries not only furnish the natives
with wax but with <i>resin</i>, which is used instead of tar for
their ships. Molina informs us that, at Coquimbo in
Chili, resin, either the product of an insect or the consequence
of an insect's biting off the buds of a particular
species of Origanum, is collected in large quantities.
The insect in question is a small smooth red caterpillar
about half an inch long, which changes into a yellowish
moth with black stripes upon the wings (<i>Phal. ceraria</i>,
Molina). Early in the spring vast numbers of these
caterpillars collect on the branches of the <i>Chila</i>, where
they form their cells of a kind of soft white wax or resin,
in which they undergo their transformations. This wax,
which is at first very white, but by degrees becomes
yellow and finally brown, is collected in autumn by the
inhabitants, who boil it in water, and make it up into
little cakes for market<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Honey</i>, another well-known product of insects, has
lost much of its importance since the discovery of sugar;
yet at the present day, whether considered as a delicious
article of food, or the base of a wholesome vinous beverage
of home manufacture, it is of no mean value even
in this country; and in many inland parts of Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
where its saccharine substitute is much dearer than with
us, few articles of rural economy, not of primary importance,
would be dispensed with more reluctantly. In the
Ukraine some of the peasants have 4 or 500 bee-hives,
and make more profit of their bees than of corn<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>; and
in Spain the number of bee-hives is said to be incredible;
a single parish priest was known to possess 5000<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>.</p>

<p>The domesticated or hive-bee, to which we are indebted
for this article, is the same according to Latreille
in every part of Europe, except in some districts of Italy,
where a different species (<i>Apis ligustica</i> of Spinola) is kept&mdash;the
same probably that is cultivated in the Morea and
the isles of the Archipelago<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>. Honey is obtained, however,
from many other species both wild and domestic.
What is called rock honey in some parts of America,
which is as clear as water and very thin, is the produce
of wild bees, which suspend their clusters of thirty or forty
waxen cells, resembling a bunch of grapes, to a rock<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>:
and in South America large quantities are collected from
the nests built in trees by <i>Trigona Amalthea</i>, and other
species of this genus recently separated from Apis<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>;
under which probably should be included the <i>Bamburos</i>,
whose honey, honest Robert Knox informs us, whole
towns in Ceylon go into the woods to gather<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>. According
to Azara, one of the chief articles of food of the Indians
who live in the woods of Paraguay is wild honey<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Captain Green observes that, in the island of Bourbon,
where he was stationed for some time, there is a bee
which produces a kind of honey much esteemed there.
It is quite of a green colour, of the consistency of oil,
and to the usual sweetness of honey superadds a certain
fragrance. It is called green honey, and is exported to
India, where it bears a high price<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>. One of the species
that has probably been attended to ages before our hive-bee,
is <i>Apis fasciata</i> of Latreille, a kind so extensively
cultivated in Egypt, that Niebuhr states he fell in upon
the Nile, between Cairo and Damietta, with a convoy of
4000 hives, which were transporting from a region where
the season for flowers had passed, to one where the spring
was later<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>. Columella says that the Greeks in like
manner sent their bee-hives every year from Achaia into
Attica; and a similar custom is not unknown in Italy, and
even in this country in the neighbourhood of heaths. In
Madagascar, according to Latreille, the inhabitants have
domesticated <i>Apis unicolor</i>; <i>A. indica</i> is cultivated in
India at Pondicherry and in Bengal; <i>A. Adansonii</i>, Latr.
at Senegal<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>; and Fabricius thinks that <i>A. acraensis</i> (<i>Centris</i>,
Syst. Piez.) <i>laboriosa</i>, and others in the East and
West Indies, might be domesticated with greater advantage
than even <i>A. mellifica</i><a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>The last, and doubtless the most valuable, product of
insects to which I have to advert is <i>Silk</i>. To estimate
justly the importance of this article, it is not sufficient to
view it as an appendage of luxury unrivalled for richness,
lustre, and beauty; and without which courts would lose
half their splendour. We must consider it, what it actually
is, as the staple article of cultivation in many large
provinces in the South of Europe, amongst the inhabitants
of which the prospect of a deficient crop causes
as great alarm as a scanty harvest of grain with us; and
after giving employment to tens of thousands in its first
production and transportation, as furnishing subsistence
to hundreds of thousands more in its final manufacture;
and thus becoming one of the most important wheels
that give circulation to national wealth.</p>

<p>But we must not confine our view to Europe. When silk
was so scarce in this country, that James the First, while
king of Scotland, was forced to beg of the Earl of Mar
the loan of a pair of silk stockings to appear in before
the English ambassador, enforcing his request with the
cogent appeal, "For ye would not, sure, that your king
should appear as a scrub before strangers&mdash;" Nay, long
before this period, even prior to the time that silk was
valued at its weight of gold at Rome, and the Emperor
Aurelian refused his empress a robe of silk because of its
dearness&mdash;the Chinese peasantry in some of the provinces,
millions in number, were clothed with this material; and
for some thousand years to the present time, it has been
both there and in India, (where a class whose occupation
was to attend silk-worms appears to have existed from
time immemorial, being mentioned in the oldest Sanscrit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
books<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>,) one of the chief objects of cultivation and manufacture.
You will admit, therefore, that when nature</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;set to work millions of spinning worms,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That in their green shops weave the smooth-hair'd silk<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To deck her sons<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she was conferring upon them a benefit scarcely inferior
to that consequent upon the gift of wool to the fleecy race,
or a fibrous rind to the flax or hemp plants; and that
mankind is not under much less obligation to Pamphila,
who, according to Aristotle, was the discoverer of the
art of unwinding and weaving silk, than to the inventors
of the spinning of those products<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>.</p>

<p>It seems to have been in Asia that silk was first manufactured;
and it was from thence that the ancients obtained
it, calling it, from the name of the country whence
it was supposed to be brought, Sericum. Of its origin
they were in a great measure ignorant, some supposing
it to be the entrails of a spider-like insect with eight legs,
which was fed for four years upon a kind of paste, and
then with the leaves of the green willow, until it burst
with fat<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>; others, that it was the produce of a worm
which built clay nests and collected wax<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>; Aristotle,
with more truth, that it was unwound from the <i>pupa</i> of
a large horned caterpillar<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>. Nor was the mode of producing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
and manufacturing this precious material known
to Europe until long after the Christian √¶ra, being first
learnt about the year 550 by two monks, who procured
in India the eggs of the silk-worm moth, with which,
concealing them in hollow canes, they hastened to Constantinople,
where they speedily multiplied, and were
subsequently introduced into Italy, of which country silk
was long a peculiar and staple commodity. It was not
cultivated in France until the time of Henry the Fourth,
who, considering that mulberries grew in his kingdom as
well as in Italy, resolved, in opposition to the opinion of
Sully, to attempt introducing it, and fully succeeded.</p>

<p>The whole of the silk produced in Europe, and the
greater proportion of that manufactured in China, is obtained
from the common silk-worm; but in India considerable
quantities are procured from the cocoons of the
larv√¶ of other moths. Of these the most important
species known are the Tusseh and Arindy silk-worms, of
which an interesting history is given by Dr. Roxburgh
in the <i>Linnean Transactions</i><a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>. These insects are both
natives of Bengal. The first (<i>Attacus Paphia</i>,) feeds
upon the leaves of the <i>Jugube tree</i> (<i>Rhamnus Jujuba</i>) or
<i>Byer</i> of the Hindoos, and of the <i>Terminalia alata glabra</i>,
Roxburgh, the <i>Asseen</i> of the Hindoos, and is found
in such abundance as from time immemorial to have afforded
a constant supply of a very durable, coarse, dark-coloured
silk, which is woven into a cloth called <i>Tusseh-doot'hies</i>,
much worn by the Brahmins and other sects;
and would doubtless be highly useful to the inhabitants
of many parts of America and of the South of Europe,
where a light and cool, and at the same time cheap and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
durable dress, such as this silk furnishes, is much wanted.
The durability of this silk is indeed astonishing. After
constant use for nine or ten years it does not show any
signs of decay. These insects are thought by the natives
of so much consequence, that they guard them by day to
preserve them from crows and other birds, and by night
from the bats.&mdash;The Arindy silk-worm (<i>Attacus? Cynthia</i>,
Drury), which feeds solely on the leaves of the <i>Palma
Christi</i>, produces remarkably soft cocoons, the silk of
which is so delicate and flossy, that it is impracticable to
wind it off: it is therefore spun like cotton; and the thread
thus manufactured is woven into a coarse kind of white
cloth of a loose texture, but of still more incredible durability
than the last, the life of one person being seldom
sufficient to wear out a garment made of it. It is used
not only for clothing, but for packing fine cloths, &amp;c.
Some manufacturers in England to whom the silk was
shown, seemed to think that it could be made here into
shawls equal to any received from India.</p>

<p>Other species, as may be inferred from an extract of a
letter given in Young's <i>Annals of Agriculture</i><a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>, are known
in China, and have been recently introduced into India.
"We have obtained," says the writer, "a monthly silk-worm
from China, which I have reared with my own
hands, and in twenty-five days have had the cocoons in
my basins, and by the twenty-ninth or thirty-first day a
new progeny feeding in my trays. This makes it a mine
to whoever would undertake the cultivation of it."</p>

<p>Whether it will ever be expedient to attempt the
breeding of the larv√¶ of any European moths, as <i>Catocala
pacta</i>, <i>Sponsa</i>, &amp;c. proposed with this view by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Fabricius<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>, seems doubtful, though certainly many of them
afford a very strong silk, and might be readily propagated;
and I have now in my possession some thread more
like cotton than silk spun by the larva of a moth, which
when I was a very young entomologist I observed (if my
memory does not deceive me) upon the Euonymus, and
from the twigs of which (not the cocoon) I unwound it.
It is even asserted that in Germany a manufacture of
silk from the cocoons of the emperor moth (<i>Saturnia
Pyri?</i>) has been established<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>. There seems no question,
however, that silk might be advantageously derived from
many native silk-worms in America. An account is
given in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of one found
there, whose cocoon is not only heavier and more productive
of silk than that of the common kind, but is so
much stronger that twenty threads will carry an ounce
more<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>. Don Luis Ne√© observed on <i>Psidium pomiferum</i>
and <i>pyriferum</i> ovate nests of caterpillars eight inches
long, of gray silk, which the inhabitants of Chilpancingo,
Tixtala, &amp;c. in America, manufacture into stockings and
handkerchiefs<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>. Great numbers of similar nests of a
dense tissue, resembling Chinese paper, of a brilliant
whiteness, and formed of distinct and separable layers,
the interior being the thinnest and extraordinarily transparent,
were observed by Humboldt in the provinces of
Mechoacan and the mountains of Santarosa at a height
of 10,500 feet above the level of the sea, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
<i>Arbutus Madr√¥no</i> and other trees. The silk of these nests,
which are the work of the social caterpillars of a Bombyx
(<i>B. Madr√¥no</i>), was an object of commerce even in
the time of Montezuma, and the ancient Mexicans pasted
together the interior layers, which may be written upon
without preparation, to form a white glossy pasteboard.
Handkerchiefs are still manufactured of it in the Intendency
of Oaxaca<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>. De Azara states that in Paraguay
a spider, which is found to near the thirtieth degree of
latitude, forms a spherical cocoon (for its eggs) an inch
in diameter, of a yellow silk, which the inhabitants spin
on account of the permanency of the colour<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>. And according
to M. B. de Lozieres, large quantities of a very
beautiful silk, of dazzling whiteness, may be collected
from the cocoons even of the Ichneumons that destroy
the larv√¶ of some moth in the West Indies which feed
upon the indigo and cassada<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>.</p>

<p>It is probable, too, that other articles besides silk might
be obtained from the larv√¶ which usually produce it, particularly
cements and varnishes of different kinds, some
hard, others elastic, from their gum and silk reservoirs,
from which it is said the Chinese procure a fine varnish,
and fabricate what is called by anglers Indian grass<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>.
The diminutive size of the animal will be thought no
objection, when we recollect that the very small quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of purple dye afforded by the <i>Purpura</i> of the ancients
did not prevent them from collecting it.</p>

<p>I now conclude this long series of letters on the injuries
caused by insects to man, and the benefits which he
derives from them; and I think you will readily admit
that I have sufficiently made good my position, that the
study of agents which perform such important functions
in the economy of nature must be worthy of attention.
Our subsequent correspondence will be devoted to the
most interesting traits in their history,&mdash;as their affection

<h2><a name="LETTER_XI" id="LETTER_XI">LETTER XI.</a></h2>

<h3><i>ON THE AFFECTION OF INSECTS FOR
THEIR YOUNG.</i></h3>


<p>Amongst the larger animals, every observer of nature
has witnessed, with admiration, that love of their
offspring which the beneficent Creator, with equal regard
to the happiness of the parent and the progeny, has interwoven
in the constitution of his creatures. Who that
has any sensibility, has not felt his heart dilate with gratitude
to the Giver of all good, in observing amongst the
domestic animals which surround him, the effects of this
divine <i>storg√©</i>, so fruitful of the most delightful sensations?
Who that is not a stock or a stone has read unmoved
the anecdote recorded in books of Natural History, of
the poor bitch, which in the agonies of a cruel dissection
licked with parental fondness her new-born offspring; or
the affecting account of the she-bear related in Phipps's
<i>Voyage to the North Pole</i>, which, herself severely wounded
by the same shot that killed her cubs, spent her last
moments in tearing and laying before them the food she
had collected, and died licking their wounds?</p>

<p>These feelings you must have experienced, but it has
scarcely occurred to you that you would have any room
for exercising them in your new pursuit. You have not,
I dare say, suspected that any similar example could
have been adduced amongst <i>insects</i>, to which at the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
glance there seems even something absurd in attributing
any thing like parental affection. An animal not so big
perhaps as a grain of wheat, feel love for its offspring&mdash;how
preposterous! we are ready to exclaim. Yet the
exclamation would be very much misplaced. Nothing
is more certain than that insects are capable of feeling
quite as much attachment to their offspring as the largest
quadrupeds. They undergo as severe privations in nourishing
them; expose themselves to as great risk in defending
them; and in the very article of death exhibit as
much anxiety for their preservation. Not that this can
be said of all insects. A very large proportion of them
are doomed to die before their young come into existence.
But in these the passion is not extinguished. It is
merely modified, and its direction changed. And when
you witness the solicitude with which they provide for
the security and sustenance of their future young, you
can scarcely deny to them love for a progeny they are
never destined to behold. Like affectionate parents in
similar circumstances, their last efforts are employed in
providing for the children that are to succeed them.</p>


<p>I. Observe the motions of that common white butterfly
which you see flying from herb to herb. You perceive
that it is not food she is in pursuit of; for flowers have
no attraction for her. Her object is the discovery of a
plant that will supply the sustenance appropriated by
Providence to her young, upon which to deposit her
eggs. Her own food has been honey drawn from the
nectary of a flower. This, therefore, or its neighbourhood,
we might expect would be the situation she would
select for them. But no: as if aware that this food would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
be to them poison, she is in search of some plant of the
cabbage tribe. But how is she to distinguish it from the
surrounding vegetables? She is taught of God! Led
by an instinct far more unerring than the practised eye
of the botanist, she recognises the desired plant the moment
she approaches it, and upon this she places her
precious burthen; yet not without the further precaution
of ascertaining that it is not preoccupied by the eggs of
some other butterfly! Having fulfilled this duty, from
which no obstacle short of absolute impossibility, no
danger however threatening, can divert her, the affectionate
mother dies.</p>

<p>This may serve as one instance of the solicitude of insects
for their future progeny. But almost every species
will supply examples similar in principle, and in
their particular circumstances even more extraordinary.
In every case (except in some remarkable instances of
mistakes of instinct, as they may be termed, which will
be subsequently adverted to) the parent unerringly distinguishes
the food suitable for her offspring, however
dissimilar to her own; or at least invariably places her
eggs, often defended from external injury by a variety of
admirable contrivances, in the exact spot where, when
hatched, the larv√¶ can have access to it.&mdash;The dragon-fly
is an inhabitant of the air, and could not exist in water:
yet in this element, which is alone adapted for her
young, she ever carefully drops her eggs. The larv√¶ of
the gad-fly (<i>Gasterophilus Equi</i>), whose history has been
before described to you<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>, are destined to live in the stomach
of the horse. How shall the parent, a two-winged
fly, convey them thither? By a mode truly extraordinary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Flying round the animal, she curiously poises
her body for an instant while she glues a single egg to
one of the hairs of his skin, and repeats this process
until she has fixed in a similar way many hundred eggs.
These, after a few days, on the application of the slightest
moisture attended by warmth, hatch into little grubs.
Whenever, therefore, the horse chances to lick any part
of his body to which they are attached, the moisture of
the tongue discloses one or more grubs, which adhering
to it by means of the saliva are conveyed into the mouth,
and thence find their way into the stomach. But here
a question occurs to you. It is but a small portion of
the horse's body which he can reach with his tongue:
what, you ask, becomes of the eggs deposited on other
parts? I will tell you how the gad-fly avoids this dilemma;
and I will then ask you if she does not discover
a provident forethought, a depth of instinct, which almost
casts into shade the boasted reason of man? She
places her eggs only on those parts of the skin which the
horse is able to reach with his tongue; nay, she confines
them almost exclusively to the knee or the shoulder, which
he is sure to lick. What could the most refined reason, the
most precise adaptation of means to an end, do more<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>?</p>

<p>Not less admirable is the parental instinct of that vast
tribe of insects already introduced to you by the name
of <i>Ichneumons</i>, whose young are destined to feed upon
the living bodies of other insects. These, as you know,
are so numerous, that scarcely an insect exists, which in
its larva state is not exposed to the attacks of one or
other of them; and even the pup√¶, nay the very eggs of
these animals, are not safe from their insidious man&#339;uvres.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
The size of the different species varies in proportion
to that of the bodies which are to be their food; some
being so inconceivably small, that the egg of a butterfly
not bigger than a pin's head is of sufficient magnitude to
nourish two of them to maturity<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>; others so large, that
the body of a full-grown caterpillar is not more than
enough for one. They are the larv√¶ of these Ichneumons
which make such havoc of our pygmy tribes: the
perfect insect is a four-winged fly, which takes no other
food than a little honey; and the great object of the female
is to discover a proper nidus for her eggs. In
search of this she is in constant motion. Is the caterpillar
of a butterfly or moth the appropriate food for her
young? You see her alight upon the plants where they
are most usually to be met with, run quickly over them,
carefully examining every leaf, and, having found the
unfortunate object of her search, insert her sting into its
flesh and there deposit an egg. In vain her victim, as
if conscious of its fate, writhes its body, spits out an acid
fluid, menaces with its tentacula, or brings into action
the other organs of defence with which it is provided.
The active Ichneumon braves every danger, and does
not desist until her courage and address have ensured
subsistence for one of her future progeny. Perhaps, however,
she discovers, by a sense the existence of which
we perceive, though we have no conception of its nature,
that she has been forestalled by some precursor of her
own tribe, that has already buried an egg in the caterpillar
she is examining. In this case she leaves it, aware
that it would not suffice for the support of two, and proceeds
in search of some other yet unoccupied.&mdash;The process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
is of course varied in the case of those minute species
of which several, sometimes as many as 150, can
subsist in a single caterpillar. The little Ichneumon
then repeats her operations until she has darted into her
victim the requisite number of eggs.</p>

<p>The larv√¶ hatched from the eggs thus ingeniously
deposited, find a delicious banquet in the body of the
caterpillar, which is sure eventually to fall a victim to
their ravages. So accurately, however, is the supply of
food proportioned to the demand, that this event does
not take place until the young Ichneumons have attained
their full growth: when the caterpillar either dies, or,
retaining just vitality enough to assume the pupa state,
then finishes its existence; the pupa disclosing not a moth
or a butterfly, but one or more full-grown Ichneumons.</p>

<p>In this strange and apparently cruel operation one
circumstance is truly remarkable. The larva of the
Ichneumon, though every day, perhaps for months, it
gnaws the inside of the caterpillar, and though at last it
has devoured almost every part of it except the skin and
intestines, carefully all this time <i>avoids injuring the vital
organs</i>, as if aware that its own existence depends on that
of the insect on which it preys! Thus the caterpillar
continues to eat, to digest, and to move, apparently little
injured, to the last, and only perishes when the parasitic
grub within it no longer requires its aid. What would
be the impression which a similar instance amongst the
race of quadrupeds would make upon us?&mdash;If, for example,
an animal&mdash;such as some impostors have pretended
to carry within them&mdash;should be found to feed
upon the inside of a dog; devouring only those parts not
essential to life, while it cautiously left uninjured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
heart, arteries, lungs, and intestines,&mdash;should we not regard
such an instance as a perfect prodigy, as an example
of instinctive forbearance almost miraculous?</p>

<p>Some Ichneumons, instead of burying their eggs in
the body of the larv√¶ that are to serve their young for
food, content themselves with gluing them to the skin of
their prey, which the young grubs pierce as soon as
hatched. Another tribe, whose activity and perseverance
are equally conspicuous, which includes the beautiful genus
<i>Chrysis</i> and many other hymenopterous insects, imitating
the insidious cuckoo, contrive to introduce their
eggs into the nests in which bees and other insects have
deposited theirs. With this view they are constantly on
the watch, and, the moment the unsuspecting mother
has quitted her cell for the purpose of collecting a store
of food or materials, glide into it and leave an egg, the
germe of a future assassin of the larva that is to spring
from that deposited by its side.</p>

<p>The females of the insects of which we have been speaking,
in providing for their offspring, are saved the trouble
of furnishing them with any habitation. Either they
occupy that of another insect, or find a convenient abode
within the body of that on which they feed. But upon
the maternal affection of another large hymenopterous
tribe, belonging to Latreille's Family of Burrowers (<i>Fossores</i>),
whose young in like manner feed on other insects,
is imposed the arduous task not merely of collecting a
supply of food, but of inclosing it along with their eggs
in cells or burrows often of considerable depth, and dug
with great labour in sand or the solid earth.</p>

<p>The general economy of these insects is similar. Having
first dug a cylindrical cavity of the requisite dimensions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and deposited an egg at the bottom, they inclose along
with it one or more caterpillars, spiders, or other insects,
each particular species for the most part selecting a distinct
kind, as a provision for the young one when hatched,
and sufficiently abundant to nourish it until it becomes
a pupa. Many thus furnish several cells. This process,
however, is varied by different species, some of whose
operations are worthy of a more detailed description.</p>

<p>One of the most early histories of the procedure of an
insect of this kind, probably the common sand-wasp (<i>Ammophila
vulgaris</i>), is left us by the excellent Ray, who
observed it along with his friend Willughby. On the
22d of June 1667, he tells us, they noticed this insect
dragging a green caterpillar thrice as big as itself, which
after thus conveying about fifteen feet, it deposited at the
entrance of a hole previously dug in the sand. Then
removing a pellet of earth from its mouth, it descended
into the cavity, and, presently returning, dragged along
with it the caterpillar. After staying awhile it again
ascended, then rolled pieces of earth into the hole, at
intervals scratching the dust into it like a dog with its
fore feet, and entering it as if to press down and consolidate
the mass: flying also once or twice to an adjoining
fir-tree, possibly to procure resin for agglutinating the
whole. Having filled the burrow to a level with the surrounding
earth so as to conceal the entrance, it took two
fir-leaves lying at hand, and placed them near the orifice
as if to mark the place.&mdash;Such is the anecdote left on record
by our illustrious countryman, of whose accuracy
of observation there can be no doubt<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>. Who that reads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
it can refrain from joining in the reflection which it calls
from him, "<i>Quis h√¶c non mihi miretur et stupeat? Quis
hujusmodi opera mer√¶ machin√¶ possit attribuere</i><a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a><i>?</i>"</p>

<p>I myself, when walking with a friend some months
ago, observed nearly similar man&#339;uvres performed by
another hymenopterous insect which may be called a
spider-wasp (<i>Pompilus</i>), which attracted our attention as
it was dragging a spider to its cell. The attitude in which
it carried its prey, namely with its feet constantly upwards;
its singular mode of walking, which was backwards,
except for a foot or two when it went forwards,
moving by jerks and making a sort of pause every few
steps; and the astonishing agility with which, notwithstanding
its heavy burthen, it glided over or between
the grass, weeds, and other numerous impediments in
the rough path along which it passed&mdash;together formed
a spectacle which we contemplated with admiration. The
distance which we thus observed it to traverse was not
less than twenty-seven feet, and great part of its journey
had probably been performed before we saw it. Once
or twice, when we first noticed it, it laid down the spider,
and making a small circuit returned and took it up again.
But for the ensuing twenty or twenty-five feet it never
stopped, but proceeded in a direct line for its burrow
with the utmost speed. When opposite the hole, which
was in a sand bank by the way side, it made a sharp
turn, as evidently aware of being in the neighbourhood
of its abode, but when advanced a little further laid down
its burthen and went to reconnoitre. At first it climbed
up the bank, but, as if discovering that this was not the
direction, soon returned, and, after another survey perceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the hole, took up the spider and dragged it in
after it.</p>

<p>In the two instances above given, one dead caterpillar
or spider only was deposited in each hole. But an insect
described by Reaumur under the name of the mason-wasp
(<i>Epipone spinipes</i>), very common in some parts
of England, after having excavated a burrow, with an
ingenuity to which on a future occasion I shall draw
your attention, places along with its egg as food for the
future young, about twelve little green grubs without
feet, which it has carefully selected full grown and conveyed
without injuring them. You will inquire, Why
this difference of procedure? With regard to the choice
of a number of small grubs rather than of one large caterpillar,
what I have said in a former letter on the subject
of different species of this tribe being appointed to
prey upon and thus keep within due limits the larv√¶ of
different kinds of insects, will be a sufficient answer. But
one circumstance creditable to the talents of the mason-wasp
as a skilful purveyor should not be omitted, namely,
that the number of grubs laid up is not always the same,
but is exactly proportioned to their size, eleven or twelve
being stored when they are small, but only eight or nine
when larger. With respect however to the caution of
the wasp in selecting full grown grubs and conveying
them uninjured to her hole, a satisfactory explanation
may be given. If those that are but partly grown were
chosen, they would die in a short time for want of food,
and putrefying would destroy the inclosed egg, or the
young one which springs from it. But when larv√¶ of
any kind have attained their full size, and are about to
pass into the pupa state, they can exist for a long period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
without any further supply. By selecting these, therefore,
and placing them uninjured in the hole, however
long the interval before the egg hatches, the disclosed
larva is sure of a sufficiency of fresh and wholesome nutriment.&mdash;To
prevent the possibility of any injury to its
egg from the motions or voracity of this living prey, the
wasp is careful to pack the whole so closely, each grub
being coiled above the other in a series of rings, and to
consolidate the earth so firmly above them, that they
have not the slightest power of motion<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>.&mdash;Those which
select more powerful caterpillars, or revenge the injuries
of their insect brethren by devoting spiders to the destruction
they have so often caused, take care to sting
them in such a manner as, without killing them outright,
will incapacitate them from doing any injury.</p>

<p>Zeal and activity in providing for the well-being of
their future progeny, not inferior to what are exhibited
by the tribe of Ichneumons, <i>Sphecina</i><a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>, and mason-wasps,
though less cruelly exerted, are also shown by various
species of wild bees, of which we have in this country a
vast number. Having first excavated a proper cell with
a dexterity and persevering labour never enough to be
admired, they next deposit in it an egg, which they cover
with a mass of pollen or honey collected with unwearied
assiduity from a thousand flowers. As soon as the grub
is hatched, it finds itself enveloped in this delicious banquet
provided for it by the cares of a mother it is doomed
never to behold; and so accurately is the repast proportioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
to its appetite and its wants, that as soon as the
whole is consumed it has no longer need of food; it clothes
itself in a silken cocoon, becomes a pupa, and after a
deep sleep of a few days bursts from its cell an active bee.</p>

<p>No circumstance connected with the <i>storg√©</i> of insects,
is more striking than the herculean and incessant labour
which it leads them cheerfully to undergo. Some of
these exertions are so disproportionate to the size of the
insect, that nothing short of ocular conviction could attribute
them to such an agent. A wild bee or a Sphex,
for instance, will dig a hole in a hard bank of earth
some inches deep and five or six times its own size, and
labour unremittingly at this arduous undertaking for
several days, scarcely allowing itself a moment for eating
or repose. It will then occupy as much time in searching
for a store of food; and no sooner is this task finished,
than it will set about repeating the process, and before
it dies will have completed five or six similar cells or
even more. If you would estimate this industry at its
proper value, you should reflect what kind of exertion it
would require in a man to dig in a few days out of hard
clay or sand, with no other tools than his nails and teeth,
five or six caverns twenty feet deep and four or five wide&mdash;for
such an undertaking would not be comparatively
greater than that of the insects in question.</p>

<p>Similar laborious exertions are not confined to the bee
or Sphex tribe. Several beetles in depositing their eggs
exhibit examples of industry equally extraordinary. The
common dor or clock (<i>Geotrupes stercorarius</i>), which
may be found beneath every heap of dung, digs a deep
cylindrical hole, and, carrying down a mass of the dung
to the bottom, in it deposits its eggs. And many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
species of the <i>Scarab√¶id√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> roll together wet dung into
round pellets, deposit an egg in the midst of each, and
when dry push them backwards by their hind feet into
holes of the surprising depth of three feet, which they
have previously dug for their reception, and which are
often several yards distant. Frequently the road lies
across a depression in the surface, and the pellet when
nearly pushed to the summit rolls back again. But our
patient Sisyphi are not easily discouraged. They repeat
their efforts again and again, and in the end their perseverance
is rewarded by success. The attention of these
insects to their eggs is so remarkable, that it was observed
in the earliest ages, and is mentioned by ancient
writers, but with the addition of many fables, as that
they were all of the male sex, that they became young
again every year, that they rolled the pellets containing
their eggs from sun-rise to sun-set every day, for twenty-eight
days without intermission<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>, &amp;c. It is one of this
tribe of beetles (<i>S. sacer</i>) whose image is so often met
with amongst the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, with
whom it was a symbol of the world, of the sun, and of a
courageous warrior. Of the world, as P. Valerianus
supposes, on account of the orbicular form of its pellets
of dung, and the notion of their being rolled from sun-rise
to sun-set; of the sun, because of the angular projections
from its head resembling rays, and the thirty
joints of the six tarsi of its feet answering to the days of
the month; and of a warrior, from the idea of manly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
courage being connected with its supposed birth from a
male only<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>. It was as symbolical of this last that its image
was worn upon the signets of the Roman soldiers; and
as typical of the sun, the source of fertility, it is yet, as
Dr. Clarke informs us, eaten by the women to render
them prolific<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>.</p>

<p>These beetles, however, in point of industry must
yield the palm to one (<i>Necrophorus Vespillo</i>) whose singular
history was first detailed by M. Gleditsch in <i>the Acts
of the Berlin Society</i> for 1752. He begins by informing
us that he had often remarked that dead moles when
laid upon the ground, especially if upon loose earth, were
almost sure to disappear in the course of two or three
days, often of twelve hours. To ascertain the cause, he
placed a mole upon one of the beds in his garden. It
had vanished by the third morning; and on digging
where it had been laid, he found it buried to the depth of
three inches, and under it four beetles which seemed to
have been the agents in this singular inhumation. Not
perceiving any thing particular in the mole, he buried it
again; and on examining it at the end of six days he
found it swarming with maggots apparently the issue of
the beetles, which M. Gleditsch now naturally concluded
had buried the carcase for the food of their future young.
To determine these points more clearly, he put four of
these insects into a glass vessel half filled with earth and
properly secured, and upon the surface of the earth two
frogs. In less than twelve hours one of the frogs was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
interred by two of the beetles: the other two ran about
the whole day as if busied in measuring the dimensions
of the remaining corpse, which on the third day was also
found buried. He then introduced a dead linnet. A
pair of the beetles were soon engaged upon the bird.
They began their operations by pushing out the earth
from under the body so as to form a cavity for its reception;
and it was curious to see the efforts which the
beetles made by dragging at the feathers of the bird from
below to pull it into its grave. The male having driven
the female away continued the work alone for five
hours. He lifted up the bird, changed its place, turned
it and arranged it in the grave, and from time to time
came out of the hole, mounted upon it and trod it under
foot, and then retired below and pulled it down. At
length, apparently wearied with this uninterrupted labour,
it came forth and leaned its head upon the earth
beside the bird without the smallest motion as if to rest
itself, for a full hour, when it again crept under the
earth. The next day in the morning the bird was an
inch and a half under ground, and the trench remained
open the whole day, the corpse seeming as if laid out
upon a bier, surrounded with a rampart of mould. In
the evening it had sunk half an inch lower, and in another
day the work was completed and the bird covered.&mdash;M.
Gleditsch continued to add other small dead animals,
which were all sooner or later buried; and the result
of his experiment was, that in fifty days four beetles
had interred in the very small space of earth allotted to
them, twelve carcases: viz. four frogs, three small birds,
two fishes, one mole, and two grasshoppers, besides the
entrails of a fish, and two morsels of the lungs of an ox.
In another experiment a single beetle buried a mole forty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
times its own bulk and weight in two days<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>. It is plain
that all this labour is incurred for the sake of placing in
security the future young of these industrious insects
along with a necessary provision of food. One mole
would have sufficed a long time for the repast of the
beetles themselves, and they could have more conveniently
fed upon it above ground than below. But if they had
left thus exposed the carcase in which their eggs were
deposited, both would have been exposed to the imminent
risk of being destroyed at a mouthful by the first
fox or kite that chanced to espy them.</p>

<p>At the first view I dare say you feel almost inclined
to pity the little animals doomed to exertions apparently
so disproportioned to their size. You are ready to exclaim
that the pains of so short an existence, engrossed
with such arduous and incessant toil, must far outweigh
the pleasures. Yet the inference would be altogether
erroneous. What strikes us as wearisome toil, is to the
little agents delightful occupation. The kind Author of
their being has associated the performance of an essential
duty with feelings evidently of the most pleasurable
description; and, like the affectionate father whose love
for his children sweetens the most painful labours, these
little insects are never more happy than when thus actively
engaged. "A bee," as Dr. Paley has well observed,
"amongst the flowers in spring, (when it is occupied
without intermission in collecting farina for its
young or honey for its associates,) is one of the cheerfullest
objects that can be looked upon. Its life appears
to be all enjoyment: so busy and so pleased<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>."</p>

<p>Of the sources of exquisite gratification which every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
rural walk will open to you, while witnessing in the animals
themselves those marks of affection for their unseen
progeny of which I have endeavoured to give you
a slight sketch, it will be none of the least fertile to
examine the various and appropriate instruments with
which insects have been furnished for the effective execution
of their labours. The young of the saw-fly tribe
(<i>Serrifera</i><a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>) are destined to feed upon the leaves of rose-trees
and various other plants. Upon the branches of
these the parent fly deposits her eggs in cells symmetrically
arranged; and the instrument with which she
forms them is a saw, somewhat like ours but far more ingenious
and perfect, being toothed on each side, or rather
consisting of two distinct saws, with their backs (the teeth
or serratures of which are themselves often serrated, and
the exterior flat sides scored and toothed), which play
alternately; and, while their vertical effect is that of a
saw, act laterally as a rasp. When by this alternate
motion the incision, or cell, is made, the two saws, receding
from each other, conduct the egg between them
into it<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>. The <i>Cicada</i>, so celebrated by the poets of antiquity,
which lays its eggs in dry wood, requires a
stronger instrument of a different construction. Accordingly
it is provided with an excellent double auger,
the sides of which play alternately and parallel to each
other, and bore a hole of the requisite depth in very hard
substances without ever being displaced.</p>

<p>The construction of the sting or ovipositor with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the different species of Ichneumon are provided, is not
less nicely adapted to its various purposes. In those
which lay their eggs in the bodies of caterpillars that
feed exposed on the leaves of plants it is short, often in
very large species not the eighth of an inch long: having
free access to their victims, a longer sting would have
been useless. But a considerable number oviposit in
larv√¶ which lie concealed where so short an instrument
could not possibly approach them. In these, therefore,
the sting is proportionably elongated, so much so that in
some small species it is three or four times the length of
the body. Thus in <i>Pimpla Manifestator</i>, whose economy
has been so pleasingly illustrated by Mr. Marsham<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>, and
which attacks the larva of a wild bee (<i>Chelostoma<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> maxillosa</i>)
lying at the bottom of deep holes in old wood, the
sting is nearly two inches long<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>: and it is not much
shorter in the more minute <i>I. Strobilell√¶</i> L., which lays
its eggs in larv√¶ concealed in the interior of fir cones,
which without such an apparatus it would never be able
to reach.</p>

<p>The tail of the females of many moths whose eggs require
to be protected from too severe a cold and too
strong a light, is furnished, evidently for application to
this very purpose, with a thick tuft of hair. But how
shall the moth detach this non-conducting material and
arrange it upon her eggs? Her ovipositor is provided at
the end with an instrument resembling a pair of pincers,
which for this purpose are as good as hands. With these,
having previously deposited her eggs upon a leaf she
pulls off her tuft of hairs, with which she so closely envelops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
them as effectually to preserve them of the required
temperature: and having performed this last duty
to her progeny she expires.</p>

<p>The ovipositor of the capricorn beetles, an infinite
host, is a flattened retractile tube, of a hard substance,
by means of which it can introduce its eggs under the
bark of timber, and so place them where its progeny
will find their appropriate food<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>. The auger used by
certain species of &#338;strus, to enable them to penetrate
the hides of oxen or deer and form a nidus for their eggs,
has been before described<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.&mdash;But to enumerate all the
varieties of these instruments would be endless.</p>

<p>The purpose which in the insects above mentioned is
answered by their anal apparatus, is fulfilled in the numerous
tribes of weevils by the long slender snout with
which their head is provided. It is with this that <i>Balaninus
Nucum</i> pierces the shell of the nut, and the weevil
(<i>Calandra granaria</i>) the skin of the grains of wheat, in
which they respectively deposit their eggs, prudently introducing
one only into each nut or grain, which is sufficient,
but not more than sufficient, for the nourishment
of the grub that will inhabit it.</p>


<p>II. Hitherto I have adverted to those insects only
which perish before their young come into existence,
and can therefore evince their affection for them in no
other way than by placing the eggs whence they are to
spring in secure situations stored with food; and these
include by far the largest portion of the race. A very
considerable number, however, extend their cares much
further: they not only watch over their eggs after depositing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
them, but attend upon their young, when excluded,
with an affectionate assiduity equal to any thing exhibited
amongst the larger animals, and in the highest degree
interesting. Of this description are some solitary insects,
as several species of the Linnean genus Sphex, earwigs,
field-bugs, and spiders: and those insects which live in
societies, namely, ants, bees, wasps, and termites: the
most striking traits of whose history in these respects I
shall endeavour to lay before you.</p>

<p>You have seen that the greater number of the <i>Sphecina</i>
after depositing their eggs in cells stored with a supply
of food, take no further care of them. Some, however,
adopt a different procedure. One of these, called by
Bonnet the <i>Mason-wasp</i>, but different from Reaumur's,
not only incloses a living caterpillar along with its egg
in the cell, which it carefully closes, but at the expiration
of a few days, when the young grub has appeared and
has consumed its provision, re-opens the nest, incloses a
second caterpillar, and again shuts the mouth: and this
operation it repeats until the young one has attained its
full growth<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>. A similar mode, according to Rolander,
is followed by <i>Ammophila vulgaris</i> as well as by the
yellowish wasp of Pennsylvania, described by Bartram
in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i><a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>, and by another related
to <i>Mellinus arvensis</i>, observed by Duhamel<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>; both
of which, however, instead of caterpillars, supply their
larv√¶ with a periodical provision of living flies.</p>

<p>What a crowd of interesting reflections are these most
singular facts calculated to excite! With what foresight
must the parent insect be endowed, thus to be aware at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
what period her eggs will be hatched into grubs, and
how long the provision she has laid up will suffice for
their support! What an extent of judgement, thus in the
midst of various other occupations to know the precise
day when a repetition of her cares will be required!
What an accuracy of memory, to recollect with such
precision the entrance to her cell, which the most acute
eye could not discover; and without compass or direction
unerringly to fly to it, often from a great distance
and after the most intricate and varied wanderings! If
we refer the whole to instinct, and to instinct doubtless
it must in the main if not wholly be referred, our admiration
is not lessened. Instinct, when simple and directed
to one object, is less astonishing; but such a complication
of instincts, applied to actions so varied and dissimilar,
is beyond our conception. We can but wonder
and adore!</p>

<p>We are indebted to De Geer for the history of a field-bug
(<i>Pentatoma grisea</i>), a species found in this country,
which shows marks of affection for her young such as I
trust will lead you, notwithstanding any repugnant association
that the name may call up, to search upon the
birch tree, which it inhabits, for so interesting an insect.
The family of this field-bug consists of thirty or forty
young ones, which she conducts as a hen does her
chickens. She never leaves them; and as soon as she
begins to move, all the little ones closely follow, and
whenever she stops assemble in a cluster round her. De
Geer having had occasion to cut a branch of birch peopled
with one of those families, the mother showed every
symptom of excessive uneasiness. In other circumstances
such an alarm would have caused her immediate flight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
but now she never stirred from her young, but kept beating
her wings incessantly with a very rapid motion, evidently
for the purpose of protecting them from the apprehended
danger<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>.&mdash;As far as our knowledge of the economy
of this tribe of insects extends, there is no other
species that manifests a similar attachment to its progeny;
but such may probably be discovered by future observers.</p>

<p>It is De Geer also that we have to thank for a series
of interesting observations on the maternal affection exhibited
by the common earwig. This curious insect so
unjustly traduced by a vulgar prejudice,&mdash;as if the Creator
had willed that the insect world should combine within
itself examples of all that is most remarkable in every
other department of nature,&mdash;still more nearly approaches
the habits of the hen in her care of her family. She absolutely
sits upon her eggs as if to hatch them&mdash;a fact
which Frisch appears first to have noticed&mdash;and guards
them with the greatest care. De Geer, having found an
earwig thus occupied, removed her into a box where
was some earth, and scattered the eggs in all directions.
She soon, however, collected them one by one with her
jaws into a heap, and assiduously sat upon them as before.
The young ones, which resemble the parent except
in wanting elytra and wings, and, strange to say, are as
soon as born larger than the eggs which contained them,
immediately upon being hatched creep like a brood of
chickens under the belly of the mother, who very quietly
suffers them to push between her feet, and will often, as
De Geer found, sit over them in this posture for some
hours<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>. This remarkable fact I have myself witnessed,
having found an earwig under a stone which I accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
turned over, sitting upon a cluster of young ones
just as this celebrated naturalist has described.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to associate the ideas of cruelty
and ferocity with the name of spider, that to attribute
parental affection to any of the tribe seems at first view
almost preposterous. Who indeed could suspect that animals
which greedily devour their own species whenever
they have opportunity, should be susceptible of the
finer feelings? Yet such is the fact. There is a spider
common under clods of earth (<i>Lycosa saccata</i>) which may
at once be distinguished by a white globular silken bag
about the size of a pea, in which she has deposited her
eggs, attached to the extremity of her body. Never miser
clung to his treasure with more tenacious solicitude than
this spider to her bag. Though apparently a considerable
incumbrance, she carries it with her every where.
If you deprive her of it, she makes the most strenuous
efforts for its recovery; and no personal danger can force
her to quit the precious load. Are her efforts ineffectual?
A stupefying melancholy seems to seize her, and
when deprived of this first object of her cares, existence
itself appears to have lost its charms. If she succeeds
in regaining her bag, or you restore it to her, her actions
demonstrate the excess of her joy. She eagerly
seizes it, and with the utmost agility runs off with it to a
place of security. Bonnet put this wonderful attachment
to an affecting and decisive test. He threw a spider
with her bag into the cavern of a large ant-lion, a ferocious
insect which conceals itself at the bottom of a
conical hole constructed in the sand for the purpose of
catching any unfortunate victim that may chance to fall
in. The spider endeavoured to run away, but was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
sufficiently active to prevent the ant-lion from seizing
her bag of eggs, which it attempted to pull under the
sand. She made the most violent efforts to defeat the
aim of her invisible foe, and on her part struggled with
all her might. The gluten, however, which fastened her
bag, at length gave way, and it separated: but the spider
instantly regained it with her jaws, and redoubled her
efforts to rescue the prize from her opponent. It was in
vain: the ant-lion was the stronger of the two, and in
spite of all her struggles dragged the object of contestation
under the sand. The unfortunate mother might
have preserved her own life from the enemy: she had
but to relinquish the bag, and escape out of the pit. But,
wonderful example of maternal affection! she preferred
allowing herself to be buried alive along with the treasure
dearer to her than her existence; and it was only
by force that Bonnet at length withdrew her from the
unequal conflict. But the bag of eggs remained with the
assassin: and though he pushed her repeatedly with a
twig of wood, she still persisted in continuing on the spot.
Life seemed to have become a burthen to her, and all
her pleasures to have been buried in the grave which
contained the germe of her progeny<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>! The attachment
of this affectionate mother is not confined to her eggs.
After the young spiders are hatched, they make their
way out of the bag by an orifice, which she is careful to
open for them, and without which they could never
escape<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>; and then, like the young of the Surinam toad
(<i>Rana pipa</i>), they attach themselves in clusters upon her
back, belly, head, and even legs; and in this situation,
where they present a very singular appearance, she carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
them about with her and feeds them until their first
moult, when they are big enough to provide their own
subsistence. I have more than once been gratified by
a sight of this interesting spectacle; and when I nearly
touched the mother, thus covered by hundreds of her
progeny, it was most amusing to see them all leap from
her back and run away in every direction.</p>

<p>A similar attachment to their eggs and young is manifested
by many other species of the same tribe, particularly
of the genera <i>Lycosa</i> and <i>Dolomeda</i>. <i>Clubiona holosericea</i>
was found by De Geer in her nest with fifty or
sixty young ones, when manifesting nothing of her usual
timidity, so obstinately did she persist in remaining with
them, that to drive her away it was necessary to cut her
whole nest in pieces<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I must now conduct you to a hasty survey of those
insects which live together in societies and fabricate
dwellings for the community, such as <i>ants</i>, <i>wasps</i>, <i>bees</i>,
<i>humble-bees</i>, and <i>termites</i>, whose great object (sometimes
combined indeed with the storing up of a stock of winter
provisions for themselves) is the nutrition and education
of their young. Of the proceedings of many of these
insects we know comparatively nothing. There are, it
is likely, some hundreds of distinct species of bees which
live in societies, and form nests of a different and peculiar
construction. The constitution of these societies is
probably as various as the exterior forms of their nests,
and their habits possibly curious in the highest degree;
yet our knowledge is almost confined to the economy
of the hive-bee and of some species of humble-bees. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
same may be said of wasps, ants, and termites, of which,
though there is a vast variety of different kinds, we are
acquainted with the history of but a very few. You will
not therefore expect more than a sketch of the most interesting
traits of affection for their young, manifested by
the common species of each genus.</p>

<p>One circumstance must be premised with regard to the
education of the young of most of those insects which live
in society, truly extraordinary, and without parallel in
any other department of nature: namely, that this office,
except under particular circumstances, is not undertaken
by the female which has given birth to them, but by the
workers, or neuters as they are sometimes called, which,
though bound to the offspring of the common mother of
the society by no other than fraternal ties, exhibit towards
them all the marks of the most ardent parental affection,
building habitations for their use, feeding them and tending
them with incessant solicitude, and willingly sacrificing
their lives in defence of the precious charge. Thus
sterility itself is made an instrument of the preservation
and multiplication of species; and females too fruitful to
educate all their young, are indulged by Providence with
a privilege without which nine tenths of their progeny
must perish.</p>

<p>The most determined despiser of insects and their concerns&mdash;he
who never deigned to open his eyes to any
other part of their economy&mdash;must yet have observed,
even in spite of himself, the remarkable attachment which
the inhabitants of a disturbed nest of <i>ants</i> manifest towards
certain small white oblong bodies with which it is
usually stored. He must have perceived that the ants are
much less intently occupied with providing for their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
safety, than in carrying off these little bodies to a place of
security. To effect this purpose the whole community is
in motion, and no danger can divert them from attempting
its accomplishment. An observer having cut an ant
in two, the poor mutilated animal did not relax in its affectionate
exertions. With that half of the body to which
the head remained attached, it contrived previously to expiring
to carry off ten of these white masses into the interior
of the nest! You will readily divine that these attractive
objects are the young of the ants in one of the first or
imperfect states. They are in fact not the eggs, as they are
vulgarly called, but the pup√¶, which the working ants
tend with the most patient assiduity. But I must give you
a more detailed account of their operations, beginning
with the actual eggs.</p>

<p>These, which are so small as to be scarcely visible to
the naked eye, as soon as deposited by the queen ant, who
drops them at random in her progress through the nest,
are taken charge of by the workers, who immediately seize
them and carry them in their mouths, in small parcels,
incessantly turning them backwards and forwards with
their tongue for the purpose of moistening them, without
which they would come to nothing. They then lay them
in heaps, which they place in separate apartments<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>, and
constantly tend until hatched into larv√¶; frequently in
the course of the day removing them from one quarter of
the nest to another, as they require a warmer or cooler,
a moister or drier atmosphere; and at intervals brooding
over them as if to impart a genial warmth<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>. Experiments
have been made to ascertain whether these assiduous
nurses could distinguish their eggs if intermixed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
particles of salt and sugar, which to an ordinary observer
they very much resemble; but the result was constantly
in favour of the sagacity of the ants. They invariably selected
the eggs from whatever materials they were mixed
with, and re-arranged them as before<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>.</p>

<p>New and more severe labours succeed the birth of the
young grubs which are disclosed from the eggs after a
few days. The working ants are now almost without remission
engaged in supplying their wants and forwarding
their growth. Every evening an hour before sunset they
regularly remove the whole brood, as well as the eggs and
pup√¶, which in an old nest all require attention at the
same time, to cells situated lower down in the earth, where
they will be safe from the cold; and in the morning they
as constantly remove them again towards the surface of
the nest. If, however, there is a prospect of cold or wet
weather, the provident ants forbear on that day transporting
their young from the inner cells, aware that their
tender frames are unable to withstand an inclement sky.
What is particularly worthy of notice in this herculean
task, the ants constantly regulate their proceedings by
the sun, removing their young according to the earlier
or later rising and setting of that luminary. As soon as
his first rays begin to shine on the exterior of the nest,
the ants that are at the top go below in great haste to
rouse their companions, whom they strike with their antenn√¶,
or, when they do not seem to comprehend them,
drag with their jaws to the summit till a swarm of busy
labourers fill every passage. These take up the larv√¶
and pup√¶, which they hastily transport to the upper part
of their habitation, where they leave them a quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
an hour, and then carry them into apartments where
they are sheltered from the sun's direct rays<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>.</p>

<p>Severe as this constant and unremitted daily labour
seems, it is but a small part of what the affection of the
working ants leads them readily to undertake. The <i>feeding</i>
of the young brood, which rests solely upon them,
is a more serious charge. The nest is constantly stored
with larv√¶ the year round, during all which time, except
in winter when the whole society is torpid, they require
feeding several times a day with a viscid half-digested
fluid that the workers disgorge into their mouths, which
when hungry they stretch out to meet those of their nurses.
Add to which, that in an old nest there are generally two
distinct broods of different ages requiring separate attention;
and that the observations of Huber make it probable
that at one period they require a more substantial
food than at another. It is true that the youngest brood
at first want but little nutriment: but still, when we consider
that they must not be neglected, that the older
brood demand incessant supplies, and in a well stocked
nest amount to 7 or 8000; and that the task of satisfying
all these cravings, as well as providing for their own
subsistence, falls to the lot of the working ants, we are
almost ready to regard the burthen as greater than can
be borne by such minute agents; and we shall not wonder
at the incessant activity with which we see them
foraging on every side.</p>

<p>Their labour does not end here. It is necessary that
the larv√¶ should be kept extremely clean; and for this
purpose the ants are perpetually passing their tongue and
mandibles over their body, rendering them by this means
perfectly white<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>. After the young grubs have attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
their full growth, they surround themselves with a silken
cocoon and become pup√¶, which, food excepted, require
as much attention as in the larva state. Every morning
they are transported from the bottom of the nest to the
surface, and every evening returned to their former quarters.
And if, as is often the case, the nest be thrown into
ruins by the unlucky foot of a passing animal, in addition
to all these daily and hourly avocations, is superadded
the immediate necessity of collecting the pup√¶ from the
earth with which they have been mixed, and of restoring
the nest to its pristine state<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more curious than the view of the interior
of a fully peopled ants' nest in summer. In one
part are stored the eggs; in another the pup√¶ are heaped
up by hundreds in spacious apartments; and in a third
we see the larv√¶ surrounded by the workers, some of
which feed them, while others keep guard, standing erect
upon their hind legs with their abdomen elevated in the
position for ejaculating their acid, than which, gunpowder
would not be more formidable to the majority of
their foes. Some again are occupied in cleaning the
alleys from obstructions of various kinds; and others
rest in perfect repose recruiting their strength for new
labours.</p>

<p>Contrary to what is observed amongst other insects,
even the extrication of the young ants from the silken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
cocoon which incloses them is imposed upon the workers,
who are taught by some sensation to us incomprehensible,
that the perfect insect is now ready to burst from
the shroud, but too weak to effect its purpose unaided.
When the workers discover that this period has arrived,
a great bustle prevails in their apartment. Three or
four mount upon one cocoon, and with their mandibles
begin to open it where the head lies. First they pull off
a few threads to render the place thinner; they then
make several small openings, and with great patience
cut the threads which separate them one by one, till an
orifice is formed sufficiently large for extracting the prisoner;
which operation they perform with the utmost
gentleness. The ant is still enveloped in its pellicle; this
the workers also pull off, carefully disengaging every
member from its case, and nicely expanding the wings
of such as are furnished with them. After thus liberating
and afterwards feeding the new-born insects, they
still for several days watch and follow them every where,
teaching them to unravel the paths and winding labyrinths
of the common habitation<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>; and when the males
and females at length take flight, these affectionate stepmothers
accompany them, mounting with them to the
summit of the highest herbs, showing the most tender
solicitude for them, (some even endeavour to retain them,)
feeding them for the last time, caressing them; and at
length, when they rise into the air and disappear, seeming
to linger for some seconds over the footsteps of these
favoured beings, of whom they have taken such exemplary
care, and whom they will never behold again<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>.</p>

<p>In the above account, exclusive of the bare fact of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
laying the eggs, no mention is made of the female ants,
the real parents of the republic. You are not from this
to suppose that they never feel the influence of this divine
principle of love for their offspring. When, indeed,
a colony is established and peopled, they have enough
to do to furnish it with eggs to produce its necessary
supply of future females, males and workers; which, according
to Gould, are laid at three different seasons<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.
This is the ordinary duty assigned to them by Providence.
Yet at the first formation of a nest, the female
acts the kind part, and performs all the maternal offices
which I have just described as peculiar to the workers;
and it is only when these become sufficiently numerous
to relieve her, that she resigns this charge and devotes
herself exclusively to oviposition<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.</p>

<p>There is one circumstance occurring at this period of
their history, which affords a very affecting example of
the self-denial and self-devotion of these admirable creatures.
If you have paid any attention to what is going
forward in an ant-hill, you will have observed some larger
than the rest, which at first sight appear, as well as the
workers, to have no wings, but which upon a closer examination
exhibit a small portion of their base, or the
sockets in which they were inserted. These are females
that have cast their wings, not accidentally but by a
<i>voluntary</i> act. When an ant of this sex first emerges from
the pupa, she is adorned with two pair of wings, the upper
or outer pair being larger than her body. With
these, when a virgin, she is enabled to traverse the fields
of ether, surrounded by myriads of the other sex, who
are candidates for her favour. But when once connubial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
rites are celebrated the unhappy husband dies, and
the widowed bride seeks only how she may provide for
their mutual offspring. Panting no more to join the choir
of a√´rial dancers, her only thought is to construct a subterranean
abode in which she may deposit and attend
to her eggs, and cherish her embryo young, till, having
passed through their various changes, they arrive at their
perfect state, and she can devolve upon them a portion
of her maternal cares. Her ample wings, which before
were her chief ornament and the instruments of her pleasure,
are now an incumbrance which incommode her in
the fulfilment of the great duty uppermost in her mind;
she therefore, without a moment's hesitation, plucks them
from her shoulders. Might we not then address females
who have families, in words like those of Solomon, "Go
to the ant, ye <i>mothers</i>, consider her ways and be wise"?</p>

<p>M. P. Huber was more than once witness to this proceeding.
He saw one female stretch her wings with a
strong effort so as to bring them before her head&mdash;she
then crossed them in all directions&mdash;next she reversed
them alternately on each side&mdash;at last, in consequence of
some violent contortions, the four wings fell at the same
moment in his presence. Another, in addition to these
motions, used her legs to assist in the work<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, from the very moment of the extrusion of the
egg to the maturity of the perfect insect, are the ants
unremittingly occupied in the care of the young of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
society, and that with an ardour of affectionate attachment
to which, when its intensity and duration are taken
into the account, we may fairly say there is nothing parallel
in the whole animal world<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>. Amongst birds and
quadrupeds we have instances of affection as strong perhaps
while it lasts, but how much shorter the period during
which it is exerted! In a month or two the young
of the former require no further attention; and if in a
state of nature some of the latter give suck to their offspring
for a longer period, it is on their parts without
effort or labour; and in both cases the time given up to
their young forms a very small part of the life of the animal.
But the little insects in question not only spend a
greater portion of time in the education of their progeny,
but devote even the whole of their existence, from their
birth to their death, to this one occupation!</p>

<p>The common hive-bee and the wasp in their attention
to their young exhibit the same general features. Both
build for their reception hexagonal cells, differing in size
according to the future sex of the included grubs, which
as soon as hatched they both feed and assiduously tend
until their transformation into pup√¶. There are peculiarities,
however, in their modes of procedure, which
require a distinct notice.</p>

<p>The economy of a nest of <i>wasps</i> differs from that of
bees, in that the eggs are laid not by a single mother or
queen, but by several; and that these mothers take the
same care as the workers in feeding the young grubs:
indeed those first hatched are fed entirely by the female
which produced them, the solitary founder of the colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
The sole survivor probably of a last year's swarm of many
thousands, this female, as soon as revived by the warmth
of spring, proceeds to construct a few cells, and deposits
in them the eggs of working wasps. The eggs are covered
with a gluten, which fixes them so strongly against
the sides of the cells, that it is not easy to separate them
unbroken. These eggs seem to require care from the
time they are laid, for the wasps many times in a day
put their heads into the cells which contain them. When
they are hatched, it is amusing to witness the activity
with which the female runs from cell to cell, putting her
head into those in which the grubs are very young, while
those that are more advanced in age thrust their heads
out of their cells, and by little movements seem to be
asking for their food. As soon as they receive their portion,
they draw them back and remain quiet. These she
feeds until they become pup√¶; and within twelve hours
after being excluded in their perfect state, they eagerly
set to work in constructing fresh cells, and in lightening
the burthen of their parent by assisting her in feeding
the grubs of other workers and females which are by this
time born. In a few weeks the society will have received
an accession of several hundred workers and many females,
which without distinction apply themselves to
provide food for the growing grubs, now become exceedingly
numerous. With this object in view, as they
collect little or no honey from flowers, they are constantly
engaged in predatory expeditions. One party
will attack a hive of bees, a grocer's sugar hogshead, or
other saccharine repository; or, if these fail, the juice of
a ripe peach or pear. You will be less indignant than
formerly, at these audacious robbers now you know
that self is little considered in their attacks, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
your ravaged fruit has supplied an exquisite banquet to
the most tender grubs of the nest, into whose extended
mouths the successful marauders, running with astonishing
agility from one cell to another, disgorge successively
a small portion of their booty in the same way that a
bird supplies her young<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>. Another party is charged
with providing more substantial aliment for the grubs of
maturer growth. These wage war upon bees, flies, and
even the meat of a butcher's stall, and joyfully return to
the nest laden with the well-filled bodies of the former,
or pieces of the latter as large as they can carry. This
solid food they distribute in like manner to the larger
grubs, which may be seen eagerly protruding their
heads out of the cells to receive the welcome meal. As
wasps lay up no store of food, these exertions are the
task of every day during the summer, fresh broods of
grubs constantly succeeding to those which have become
pup√¶ or perfect insects; and in autumn, when the colony
is augmented to 20 or 30,000, and the grubs in proportion,
the scene of bustle which it presents may be
readily conceived.</p>

<p>Though such is the love of wasps for their young, that
if their nest be broken almost entirely in pieces they will
not abandon it<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>, yet when the cold weather approaches,
a melancholy change ensues, followed by a cruel catastrophe,
which at first you will be apt to regard as ill
comporting with this affectionate character. As soon as
the first sharp frost of October has been felt, the exterior
of a wasp's nest becomes a perfect scene of horror. The
old wasps drag out of the cells all the grubs and unrelentingly
destroy them, strewing their dead carcases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
around the door of their now desolate habitation. "What
monsters of cruelty!" I hear you exclaim, "what detestable
barbarians!" But be not too hasty. When you
have coolly considered the circumstances of the case, you
will view this seemingly cruel sacrifice in a different light.
The old wasps have no stock of provisions: the benumbing
hand of Winter is about to incapacitate them from
exertion; while the season itself affords no supply. What
resource then is left? Their young must linger on a
short period, suffering all the agonies of hunger, and at
length expire. They have it in their power at least to
shorten the term of this misery&mdash;to cut off its bitterest
moments. A sudden death by their own hands is comparatively
a merciful stroke. This is the only alternative;
and thus, in fact, this apparent ferocity is the last
effort of tender affection, active even to the end of life.
I do not mean to say that this train of reasoning actually
passes through the mind of the wasps. It is more correct
to regard it as having actuated the benevolent Author
of the instinct so singularly, and without doubt so
wisely, excited. Were a nest of wasps to survive the
winter, they would increase so rapidly, that not only
would all the bees, flies, and other animals on which they
prey, be extirpated, but man himself find them a grievous
pest. It is necessary, therefore, that the great mass should
annually perish; but that they may suffer as little as
possible, the Creator, mindful of the happiness of the
smallest of his creatures, has endowed a part of the society,
at the destined time, with the wonderful instinct
which, previously to their own death, makes them the
executioners of the rest.</p>

<p>Wasps in the construction of their nests have solely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
in view the accommodation of their young ones; and to
these their cells are exclusively devoted. <i>Bees</i>, on the
contrary, (I am speaking of the common hive-bee,) appropriate
a considerable number of their cells to the reception
of honey intended for the use of the society. Yet
the education of the young brood is their chief object,
and to this they constantly sacrifice all personal and selfish
considerations. In a new swarm the first care is to
build a series of cells to serve as cradles; and little or
no honey is collected until an ample store of <i>bee-bread</i>,
as it is called, has been laid up for their food. This bee-bread
is composed of the pollen of flowers, which the
workers are incessantly employed in gathering, flying
from flower to flower, brushing from the stamens their
yellow treasure, and collecting it in the little baskets with
which their hind legs are so admirably provided; then
hastening to the hive, and having deposited their booty,
returning for a new load. The provision thus furnished
by one set of labourers is carefully stored up by another,
until the eggs which the queen-bee has laid, and which
adhering by a glutinous covering she places nearly upright
in the bottom of the cell, are hatched. With this
bee-bread after it has undergone a conversion into a sort
of whitish jelly by being received into the bee's stomach,
where it is probably mixed with honey<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> and regurgitated,
the young brood immediately upon their exclusion, and
until their change into nymphs, are diligently fed by
other bees, which anxiously attend upon them and several
times a day afford a fresh supply. Different bees are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
seen successively to introduce their heads into the cells
containing them, and after remaining in that position
some moments, during which they replace the expended
provision, pass on to those in the neighbourhood. Others
often immediately succeed, and in like manner put in
their heads as if to see that the young ones have every
thing necessary; which being ascertained by a glance,
they immediately proceed, and stop only when they find
a cell almost exhausted of food. That the office of these
purveyors is no very simple affair will be admitted, when
it is understood that the food of all the grubs is not the
same, but that it varies according to their age, being insipid
when they are young, and, when they have nearly
attained maturity, more sugary and somewhat acid. The
larv√¶ destined for queen-bees, too, require a food altogether
different from that appropriated to those of drones
and workers. It may be recognised by its sharp and
pungent taste.</p>

<p>So accurately is the supply of food proportioned to
the wants of the larv√¶, that when they have attained
their full growth and are ready to become nymphs, not
an atom is left unconsumed. At this period, intuitively
known to their assiduous foster-parents, they terminate
their cares by sealing up each cell with a lid of wax, convex
in those containing the larv√¶ of drones, and nearly
flat in those containing the larv√¶ of workers, beneath
which the inclosed tenants spin in security their cocoon.&mdash;In
all these labours neither the queen nor the drones
take the slightest share. They fall exclusively upon the
workers, who, constantly called upon to tend fresh broods,
as those brought to maturity are disposed of, devote
nearly the whole of their existence to these maternal
offices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Humble-bees</i><a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>, which in respect of their general policy
must, when compared with bees and wasps, be regarded
as rude and untutored villagers, exhibit nevertheless
marks of affection to their young quite as strong as their
more polished neighbours. The females, like those of
wasps, take a considerable share in their education.
When one of them has with great labour constructed a
commodious waxen cell, she next furnishes it with a
store of pollen moistened with honey; and then having
deposited six or seven eggs, carefully closes the orifice
and minutest interstices with wax. But this is not the
whole of her task. By a strange instinct, which, however,
may be necessary to keep the population within
due bounds, the workers, while she is occupied in laying
her eggs, endeavour to seize them from her, and, if they
succeed, greedily devour them. To prevent this violence,
her utmost activity is scarcely adequate; and it is only
after she has again and again beat off the murderous intruders
and pursued them to the furthest verge of the
nest, that she succeeds in her operation. When finished,
she is still under the necessity of closely guarding the
cell, which the gluttonous workers would otherwise tear
open, and devour the eggs. This duty she performs
for six or eight hours with the vigilance of an Argus, at
the end of which time they lose their taste for this food,
and will not touch it even when presented to them. Here
the labours of the mother cease, and are succeeded by
those of the workers. These know the precise hour when
the grubs have consumed their stock of food, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
that time to their maturity regularly feed them with either
honey or pollen, introduced in their proboscis through
a small hole in the cover of the cell opened for the occasion
and then carefully closed.</p>

<p>They are equally assiduous in another operation. As
the grubs increase in size the cell which contained them
becomes too small, and in their exertions to be more at
ease they split its thin sides. To fill up these breaches
as fast as they occur with a patch of wax, is the office of
the workers, who are constantly on the watch to discover
when their services are wanted; and thus the cells daily
increase in size, in a way which to an observer ignorant
of the process seems very extraordinary.</p>

<p>The last duty of these affectionate foster-parents is to
assist the young bees in cutting open the cocoons which
have inclosed them in the state of <i>pup√¶</i>. A previous labour
however must not be omitted. The workers adopt
similar measures with the hive-bee for maintaining the
young pup√¶ concealed in these cocoons in a genial temperature.
In cold weather and at night they get upon
them and impart the necessary warmth by brooding over
them in clusters. Connected with this part of their
domestic economy, M. P. Huber, a worthy scion of a
celebrated stock, and an inheritor of the science and
merits of the great Huber as well as of his name, in his
excellent paper on these insects in the sixth volume of
the Linnean Transactions, from which most of these
facts are drawn, relates a singularly curious anecdote.</p>

<p>In the course of his ingenious and numerous experiments,
M. Huber put under a bell-glass about a dozen
humble-bees without any store of wax, along with a
comb of about ten silken cocoons so unequal in height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
that it was impossible the mass should stand firmly.
Its unsteadiness disquieted the humble-bees extremely.
Their affection for their young led them to mount upon
the cocoons for the sake of imparting warmth to the inclosed
little ones, but in attempting this the comb tottered
so violently that the scheme was almost impracticable.
To remedy this inconvenience, and to make the comb
steady, they had recourse to a most ingenious expedient.
Two or three bees got upon the comb, stretched themselves
over its edge, and with their heads downwards
fixed their fore feet on the table upon which it stood,
whilst with their hind feet they kept it from falling. In
this constrained and painful posture, fresh bees relieving
their comrades when weary, did these affectionate little
insects support the comb for nearly three days! At the
end of this period they had prepared a sufficiency of wax
with which they built pillars that kept it in a firm position:
but by some accident afterwards these got displaced,
when they had again recourse to their former
man&#339;uvre for supplying their place, and this operation
they perseveringly continued until M. Huber, pitying
their hard case, relieved them by fixing the object of
their attention firmly on the table<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be struck with the reflection
that this most singular fact is inexplicable on the supposition
that insects are impelled to their operations by a
blind instinct alone. How could mere machines have
thus provided for a case which in a state of nature has
probably never occurred to ten nests of humble-bees
since the creation? If in this instance these little animals
were not guided by a process of reasoning, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
is the distinction between reason and instinct? How
could the most profound architect have better adapted
the means to the end&mdash;how more dexterously <i>shored</i> up
a tottering edifice, until his beams and his props were in
readiness?</p>

<p>With respect to the operations of the <i>termites</i> in rearing
their young I have not much to observe. All that
is known is, that they build commodious cells for their
reception, into which the eggs of the queen are conveyed
by the workers as soon as laid, and where when hatched
they are assiduously fed by them until they are able to
provide for themselves.</p>

<p>In concluding this subject, it may not be superfluous
to advert to an objection which is sometimes thrown out
against regarding with any particular sympathy the affection
of the lower animals to their young, on the ground
that this feeling is in them the result of corporeal sensation
only, and wholly different from that love which
human parents feel for their offspring. It is true that
the latter involves moral considerations which cannot
have place in the brute creation; but it would puzzle
such objectors to explain in what respect the affection
which a mother feels for her new-born infant the moment
it has seen the light, differs from that of an insect
for its progeny. The affection of both is purely physical,
and in each case springs from sensations interwoven
by the Creator in the constitution of his creatures. If
the parental love of the former is worthy of our tenderest
sympathies, that of the latter cannot be undeserving of
some portion of similar feeling.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XII" id="LETTER_XII">LETTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3><i>ON THE FOOD OF INSECTS.</i></h3>


<p>Insects like other animals draw their <i>food</i> from the
vegetable and animal kingdoms; but a very slight survey
will suffice to show that they enjoy a range over far
more extensive territories.</p>

<p>To begin with the vegetable kingdom.&mdash;Of this vast
field the larger animals are confined to a comparatively
small portion. Of the thousands of plants which clothe
the face of the earth, when we have separated the grasses
and a trifling number of herbs and shrubs, the rest are
disgusting to them, if not absolute poisons. But how
infinitely more plenteous is the feast to which Flora invites
the insect tribes! From the gigantic banyan which
covers acres with its shade, to the tiny fungus scarcely
visible to the naked eye, the vegetable creation is one
vast banquet at which her insect guests sit down. Perhaps
not a single plant exists which does not afford a
delicious food to some insect, not excluding even those
most nauseous and poisonous to other animals&mdash;the acrid
euphorbias, and the lurid henbane and nightshade. Nor
is it a presumptuous supposition that a considerable proportion
of these vegetables were created expressly for
their entertainment and support. The common nettle
is of little use either to mankind or the larger animals,
but you will not doubt its importance to the class of insects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
when told that at least thirty distinct species feed
upon it. But this is not all. The larger herbivorous
animals are confined to a foliaceous or farinaceous diet.
They can subsist on no other part of a plant than its
leaves and seeds, either in a recent or dried state, with
the addition sometimes of the tender twigs or bark.
Not so the insect race; to different tribes of which every
part of a plant supplies appropriate food. Some attack
its roots; others select the trunk and branches; a third
class feed upon the leaves; a fourth with yet more delicate
appetite prefer the flowers; and a fifth the fruit or
seeds. Even still further selection takes place. Of those
which feed upon the roots, stem, and branches, of vegetables,
some larv√¶ eat only the bark (<i>Sesia apiformis</i>, &amp;c.),
others the alburnum (<i>Semasia W&#339;berana</i>), others the
exuding resinous or other excretions (<i>Scoparia Resinella</i>),
a third class the pith (<i>Xanthia Ochraceago</i>), and
a fourth penetrate into the heart of the solid wood (<i>Prionus</i>,
<i>Lamia</i>, <i>Cerambyx</i>, &amp;c.). Of those which prefer the
leaves, some taste nothing but the sap which fills their
veins (<i>Aphides</i> in all their states), others eat only the
parenchyma, never touching the cuticle (subcutaneous
<i>Tine√¶</i>, <i>Gracillaria?</i>) others only the lower surface of
the leaf (many <i>Tortrices</i>), while a fourth description devour
the whole substance of the leaf (most <i>Lepidoptera</i>).
And of the flower-feeders, while some eat the very petals
(<i>Cucullia Verbasci</i>, <i>Xylina Linari√¶</i>, &amp;c.), others in
their perfect state select the pollen which swells the anthers
(bees, <i>Leptur√¶</i>, and <i>Mordell√¶</i>), and a still larger
class of these the honey secreted in the nectaries (most
of the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and <i>Diptera</i>).</p>

<p>Nor are insects confined to vegetables in their recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
or unmanufactured state. A beam of oak when it has
supported the roof of a castle five hundred years, is as
much to the taste of some, (<i>Anobia</i>,) as the same tree
was in its growing state to that of others; another class
(<i>Ptini</i>) would sooner feast on the herbarium of Brunfelsius,
than on the greenest herbs that grow; and a third
(<i>Tine√¶</i>, <i>Termites</i>), to whom</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... a river and a sea<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are a dish of tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a kingdom bread and butter,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>would prefer the geographical treasures of Saxton or
Speed, in spite of their ink and alum, to the freshest
rind of the flax plant.&mdash;The larva of a little fly (<i>Oscinis
cellaris</i>), whose economy, as I can witness from my own
observations, is admirably described by Mentzelius<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>,
disdains to feed on any thing but wine or beer, which
like Boniface in the play it may be said both to eat and
drink, though, unlike its toping counterpart, indifferent
to the age of its liquor, which whether sweet or sour is
equally acceptable.</p>

<p>A diversity of food almost as great may be boasted by
the insects which feed on animal substances. Some
(flesh-flies, carrion-beetles, &amp;c.) devour dead carcases
only, which they will not touch until imbued with the
<i>haut gout</i> of putridity. Others, like Mr. Bruce's Abyssinians,
preferring their meat before it has passed through
the hands of the butcher, select it from living victims,
and may with justice pride themselves upon the peculiar
freshness of their diet. Of these last, different tribes
follow different procedures. The Ichneumons devour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
the flesh of the insects into which they have insinuated
themselves. Some of the &#338;stri, fixed in a spacious
apartment beneath the skin of an ox or deer, regale
themselves on a purulent secretion with which they are
surrounded. Others of the same tribe, partial to a higher
temperature, attach themselves to the interior of the stomach
of a horse, and in a bath of chyme of 102 degrees
of Fahrenheit revel on its juices. The various species
of horse-flies dart their sharp lancets into the veins of
quadrupeds, and satiate themselves in living streams;
while the gnat, the flea, the bug, and the louse, plunge
their proboscis even into those of us lords of the creation,
and banquet on "the ruddy drops which warm our
hearts." Some make their repast upon birds only, as
the fly of the swallow, and other <i>Ornithomyi√¶</i>, and
the bird-louse; insects nearly allied, though one is dipterous
and the other apterous. And a most singular
animal belonging to the latter tribe (<i>Nycteribia Vespertilionis</i>)
revenges upon the bat its ravages of the insect
world<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>. Another numerous class kill their prey outright,
either devouring its solid parts, as the predaceous and
rove-beetles, &amp;c., or imbibing its juices only, as the infinite
hordes of the field-bug tribe. And the larv√¶ of the gnat,
chameleon (<i>Stratyomis</i>), and other flies aquatic in that
state, the leviathans of the world of animalcules, swallow
whole hosts of these minute inhabitants of pools and
ponds at a gulp, causing with their oral apparatus a
vortex in the water, down which myriads of victims are
incessantly hurried into their destructive maw.</p>

<p>But not only animals themselves, almost every animal
substance that can be named is the appropriate food of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
some insect. Multitudes find a delicious nutriment in
excrements of various kinds. Matters apparently so indigestible
as hair, wool, and leather, are the sole food of
many moths in the larva state (<i>Tinea tapetzella</i>, <i>pellionella</i>,
&amp;c.). Even feathers are not rejected by others;
and the grub of a beetle (<i>Anthrenus Mus√¶orum</i>), with
powers of stomach which the dyspeptic sufferer may
envy, will live luxuriously upon horn<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>.</p>

<p>For the most part, insects feeding upon animal substances
will not touch vegetables, and <i>vice vers√¢</i>. You
must not however take the rule without exceptions. Many
caterpillars (as those of <i>Thyatira derasa</i>, <i>Chariclea Delphinii</i>,
&amp;c.), though plants are their proper food, will
occasionally devour other caterpillars, and sometimes
even their own species. The large green grasshopper
(<i>Acrida viridissima</i>), and probably others of the order,
will eat smaller insects as well as its usual vegetable food<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>;
so also will the larv√¶ of many <i>Phrygane√¶</i>. <i>Allantus marginellus</i>,
as I was last summer amused by witnessing, like
many <i>Scatophag√¶</i>, sips the nectar of umbelliferous plants
only till a fly comes within its reach, pouncing upon
which it gladly quits its vegetable for an animal repast.
<i>Anobium paniceum</i>, which ordinarily feeds upon wood,
was, as I before mentioned, once found by Mr. Sheppard
in great abundance living upon the dried Cantharides
(<i>Cantharis vesicatoria</i>) of the shops. On the other hand,
<i>Necrophorus mortuorum</i>, which subsists on carcases, and
many other carnivorous species, will make a hearty meal
of a putrid fungus; <i>Ptinus Fur</i> devours indifferently
dried birds or plants, not refusing even tobacco; and
from the impossibility that one of a million of the innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
swarms of gnats which abound in swampy places,
particularly in regions which but for them would be lost
to sensitive existence, should ever taste blood, it seems
clear that they are usually contented with vegetable aliment.
Indeed the males, as well as those of the horse-fly
of which even the females readily imbibed the sugared
fluid offered to them by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>, never suck blood at
all; so that they must either feed on vegetable matter,
which in fact I have observed them to do, or fast during
their whole existence in the perfect state.</p>

<p>Though insects, generally considered, have thus a
much more extensive bill of fare than the larger animals,
each individual species is commonly limited to a more
restricted diet. Many both of animal and vegetable
feeders are absolutely confined to one kind of food, and
cannot exist upon any other. The larva of <i>Gasterophilus
Equi</i> can subsist no where but in the stomach of the
horse or ass, which animals therefore this insect might
boast with some show of reason to have been created for
its use rather than for ours, being to us useful only,
but to it indispensable. The larv√¶ of <i>Syrphus Pyrastri</i>
according to De Geer eat no other Aphis but that of the
rose<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>. Most Ichneumons and <i>Sphecina</i> prey each upon
a single species of insect only, which therefore they
would seem to have been formed for the express purpose
of keeping within due limits. Reaumur mentions having
once found in a parcel of decaying wood the nests of six
different kinds of the latter tribe, each of which was filled
with flies of a distinct species<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>. <i>Cerceris auritus</i> and
<i>Philanthus l√¶tus</i> in the larva state feed solely on the
weevil tribe of <i>Coleoptera</i>, the latter being restricted even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
to the short-rostrum'd family, as <i>Otiorhynchus raucus</i>,
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>, while <i>Bembex rostrata</i>, another hymenopterous insect,
selects flies, as <i>Musca C√¶sar</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>A very large proportion of species, however, are able
to subsist on several kinds of food. Amongst the carnivorous
tribes, it is indifferent to most of those which
prey upon putrid substances from what source they have
been derived: and the predaceous insects, such as the
<i>Libellulina</i>, <i>Telephorus</i>, <i>Empis</i>, the <i>Araneid√¶</i>, &amp;c. will
attack most smaller insects inferior to them in strength,
not excepting in many instances their own species. The
wax-moth larva (<i>Galleria Cereana</i>) will for want of wax
eat paper, wafers, wool, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>: another Tinea described
by Reaumur, and before adverted to, attacks chocolate<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>,
which cannot have been its natural food, even selecting
that most highly perfumed; and the Tine√¶ which devour
dressed wool, but happily for the farmer and wool-stapler
refuse it when unwashed, must have existed when no manufactured
wool was accessible.&mdash;The vegetable feeders
are under greater restrictions, yet probably the majority
can subsist on different kinds of food. This is certainly
true of most lepidopterous larv√¶, several of which as well
as many <i>Coleoptera</i> (<i>Haltica oleracea</i>, &amp;c.) are polyphagous,
eating almost every plant. It is worthy of remark,
however, that when some of these have fed for a time on
one plant they will die rather than eat another, which
would have been perfectly acceptable to them if accustomed
to it from the first<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>. Here too it must be borne
in mind, that by far the greater part of insects feed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
different substances in their different states of existence,
eating one kind of food in the larva and another in the
imago state. This is the case with the whole Order <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
which in the former eat plants chiefly, in the
latter nothing but honey or the sweet juices of fruit,
which they have often been observed to imbibe; and the
same rule obtains also in regard to most dipterous and
hymenopterous insects. Those which eat one kind of
food in both states, are chiefly of the remaining orders.</p>

<p>I have said that insects, like other animals, draw their
subsistence from the vegetable or animal kingdoms. But
I ought not to omit noticing that some authors have
conceived that several species feed upon mineral substances<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>.
Not to dwell upon Barchewitz's idle tale of
East Indian ants which eat iron<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>, or on the stone-eating
caterpillars recorded in the Memoirs of the French Academy<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>,
which are now known to erode the walls on which
they are found, solely for the purpose of forming their
cocoons; Reaumur and Swammerdam have both stated
the food of the larv√¶ of <i>Ephemer√¶</i> to be earth, that being
the only substance ever found in their stomachs and intestines,
which are filled with it. This supposition, which
if correct renders invalid the definition by which Mirbel
(and my friend Dr. Alderson of Hull long before him)
proposed to distinguish the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
is certainly not inadmissible; for, though we might
not be inclined to give much weight to Father Paulian's
history of a flint-eater who digested flints and stone<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>,
the testimony of Humboldt seems to prove that the human
race is capable of drawing nutriment from earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
which, if the odious Ottomaques can digest and assimilate,
may doubtless afford support to the larv√¶ of Ephemer√¶.
Yet after all it is perhaps more probable that
these insects feed on the decaying vegetable matter intermixed
with the earth in which they reside, from which
after being swallowed it is extracted by the action of the
stomach: like the sand that, from being found in a similar
situation, Borelli erroneously supposed to be the
food of many <i>Testacea</i>, though in fact a mere extraneous
substance.</p>

<p>The majority of insects, either imbibing their food in
a liquid state, or feeding on succulent substances, require
no aqueous fluid for diluting it. Water, however, is essential
to bees, ants, and some other tribes, which drink
it with avidity; as well as in warm climates to many <i>Lepidoptera</i>,
which are there chiefly taken in court yards,
near the margins of drains, &amp;c. Even some larv√¶ which
feed upon juicy leaves have been observed to swallow
drops of dew; and one of them (<i>Odenestis potatoria</i>),
which (according to Goedart) after drinking lifts up its
head like a hen, has received its name from this circumstance.
That it is not the mere want of succulency in
the food which induces the necessity of drink, is plain
from those larv√¶ which live entirely on substances so
dry that it is almost unaccountable whence the juices of
their body are derived. The grub of an Anobium will
feed for months upon a chair that has been baking before
the fire for half a century, and from which even the
chemist's retort could scarcely extract a drop of moisture;
and will yet have its body as well filled with fluids as
that of a leaf-fed caterpillar.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of insects always feed themselves.
The young however of those which live in societies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
as the hive- and humble-bees, wasps, ants, &amp;c. are
fed by the older inhabitants of the community, which also
frequently feed each other. Many of these last insects are
distinguished from the majority of their race, which live
from day to day and take no thought for the morrow, by
the circumstance of storing up food. Of those which feed
themselves, the larger proportion have imposed upon
them the task of providing for their own wants; but the
tribe of Spheges, wild bees, and some others, are furnished
in the larva state by the parent insect with a supply
of food sufficient for their consumption until they
have attained maturity.</p>

<p>As to their <i>time</i> of feeding, insects may be divided into
three great classes: the day-feeders, the night-feeders,
and those which feed indifferently at all times. You
have been apt to think, I dare say, that when the sun's
warmer beams have waked the insect youth, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ten thousand forms, ten thousand different tribes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">People the blaze,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>you see before you the whole insect world. You are not
aware that a host as numerous shun the glare of day, and,
like the votaries of fashion, rise not from their couch until
their more vulgar brethren have retired to rest. While
the painted butterfly, the "fervent bees," and the quivering
nations of flies, which sport</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thick in yon stream of light, a thousand ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upward and downward thwarting and convolved,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>love to bask in the sun's brightest rays, and search for
their food amidst his noon-tide fervor, an immense multitude
stir not before the sober time of twilight, and eat
only when night has overshadowed the earth. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
only, the vast tribe of moths quit their hiding-places;
"the shard-born<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> beetle with his drowsy hum," accompanied
by numerous others of his order, sallies forth; the
airy gnat-flies institute their dances; and the solitary
spider stretches his net. All these retire into concealment
at the approach of light.&mdash;Some few larv√¶ (<i>Agrotis
exclamationis</i>, &amp;c.) have similar habits, and those of one
singular genus before adverted to (<i>Nycterobius</i>) are remarkable
for providing in the night a store of food which
they consume in the day; but to the generality of these
the period of feeding is indifferent, and most of them
seem to eat with little intermission night and day.</p>

<p>Insects like other animals take in their food by the
mouth (in <i>Chermes</i> and <i>Coccus</i>, indeed, the rostrum seems
to be, but really is not, inserted in the breast, between
the fore-legs), but there is one exception to this rule.
The singular <i>Uropoda vegetans</i>, which is such a plague
to some beetles, derives its nutriment from them by means
of a filiform pedicle or umbilical cord attached to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
anus; and what increases the singularity, sometimes several
of these mites form a kind of chain, of which the
first only is fixed by its pedicle to the beetle, each of the
remainder being similarly connected with the one that
precedes it; so that the nutriment drawn from the beetle
passes to the last through the bodies and umbilical cords
of the individuals which are intermediate<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>. Some have
regarded these bodies as true eggs; and their analogy
with the pedunculated eggs of <i>Trombidium aquaticum</i>,
which also seem to derive nourishment from the water-boatmen,
&amp;c. to which they are fixed, and still more the
circumstance of their ultimately losing their pedicle and
detaching themselves from the infested beetles, give plausibility
to the idea. Yet these animals are certainly furnished
with feet, and have according to De Geer<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> a part
resembling a mouth&mdash;characters which cannot be attributed
to any egg.</p>

<p>In the variety of their instruments of nutrition, which
you must bear in mind are often quite different in the
larva and perfect states, insects leave all other animals
far behind. In common with them, a vast number (the
orders <i>Coleoptera</i>, <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and <i>Orthoptera</i>, and the
larv√¶ of <i>Lepidoptera</i>, some <i>Diptera</i>, &amp;c.) are furnished
with jaws, but of very different constructions, and all admirably
adapted for their intended services; some sharp,
and armed with spines and branches for tearing flesh;
others hooked for seizing, and at the same time hollow
for suction; some calculated like shears for gnawing
leaves; others more resembling grindstones, of a strength
and solidity sufficient to reduce the hardest wood to powder:
and this singularity attends the major part of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
insects, that they possess in fact two pairs of jaws, an
upper and an under pair, both placed horizontally, not
vertically, the former apparently in most cases for the
seizure and mastication of their prey; the latter, when
hooked, for retaining and tearing, while the upper comminute
it previously to its being swallowed<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>.</p>

<p>To the remainder of the class of insects, a mighty host,
jaws would have been useless. Their refined liquid food
requires instruments of a different construction, and with
these they are profusely furnished. The innumerable
tribes of moths and butterflies eat nothing but the honey
secreted in the nectaries of flowers, which are frequently
situated at the bottom of a tube of great length. They
are accordingly provided with an organ exquisitely fitted
for its office&mdash;a slender tubular tongue, more or less long,
sometimes not shorter than three inches, but spirally convoluted
when at rest, like the main spring of a watch,
into a convenient compass. This tongue, which they
have the power of instantly unrolling, they dart into the
bottom of a flower, and, as through a siphon, draw up a
supply of the delicious nectar on which they feed. A
letter would scarcely suffice for describing fully the admirable
structure of this organ. I must content myself
therefore with here briefly observing that it is of a cartilaginous
substance, and apparently composed of a series
of innumerable rings, which, to be capable of such rapid
convolution, must be moved by an equal number of distinct
muscles; and that, though seemingly simple, it is in
fact composed of three distinct tubes, the two lateral ones
cylindrical and entire, intended, as Reaumur thinks, for
the reception of air; and the intermediate one, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
which alone the honey is conveyed, nearly square, and
formed of two separate grooves projecting from the lateral
tubes; which grooves, by means of a most curious
apparatus of hooks like those in the lamin√¶ of a feather,
inosculate into each other, and can be either united into
an air-tight canal, or be instantly separated, at the pleasure
of the insect<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>.</p>

<p>Another numerous race, the whole of the order <i>Hemiptera</i>,
abstract the juices of plants or of animals by
means of an instrument of a construction altogether different&mdash;a
hollow grooved beak, often jointed, and containing
three bristle-formed lancets, which, at the same
time that they pierce the food, apply to each other so
accurately as to form one air-tight tube, through which
the little animals suck up<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> their repast; thus, forming a
pump, which, more effective than ours, digs the well
from which it draws the fluid<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>.</p>

<p>A third description of insects, those of the order <i>Diptera</i>,
comprising the whole tribe of flies, have a sucker
formed on the same general plan as that last described,
but of a much more complicated and varied structure.
It is in like manner composed of a grooved case and
several included lancets; but the case, although horny,
rigid and beak-like in some, is in others fleshy, flexible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
and more resembling the proboscis of an elephant, and
terminates in two turgid liplets: and the accompanying
lancets are themselves included in an upper hollow case,
in connexion with which they probably compose an air-tight
tube for suction. The number and form of these
instruments is extremely various. In some genera (<i>Musca</i>)
there is but one, which resembles a sharp lancet.
Others (<i>Empis</i>, <i>Asilus</i>,) have three, the two lateral ones
needle-shaped, that in the middle like a scymetar; together
forming so keen an apparatus, that De Geer has
seen an Asilus pierce with it the elytra of a lady-bird;
and I have myself caught them with not only an <i>Elater</i>
and weevil, but even a <i>Hister</i> in their mouths. In many
horse-flies we find four; two precisely resembling lancets,
and two, even to the very handles, buck-hafted carving-knives<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.
The blood-thirsty gnat has five, some acutely
lanced at the extremity, and others serrated on one side.
The flea, the spider, the scorpion have all instruments
for taking their food of a construction altogether different<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>.
But it is impossible here to attempt even a sketch
of the variations in these organs which take place in the
apterous genera, and in many of the dipterous larv√¶.
Suffice it to say that they all manifest the most consummate
skill in their adaptation to the purposes of the insects
which are provided with them, and which can often
employ them not only as instruments for preparing food,
but as weapons of offence and defence, as tools in the
building of their nests, and even as feet.</p>

<p>Some insects in their perfect state, though furnished
with organs of feeding, make no use of them, and consume
no food whatever. Of this description are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
moth which proceeds from the silk-worm, and several
others of the same order; the different species of gad-flies,
and the Ephemer√¶, insects whose history is so well known
as to afford a moral or a simile to those most ignorant of
natural history. All these live so short a time in the
perfect state as to need no food. Indeed it may be laid
down as a general rule, that almost all insects in this
state eat much less than in that of larv√¶. The voracious
caterpillar when transformed into a butterfly needs only
a small quantity of honey; and the gluttonous maggot,
when become a fly, contents itself with a drop or two of
any sweet liquid.</p>

<p>While in the state of larv√¶ the quantity of food consumed
by insects is vastly greater in proportion to their
bulk than that required by larger animals. Many caterpillars
eat daily twice their weight of leaves, which is as if
an ox, weighing sixty stone, were to devour every twenty-four
hours three quarters of a ton of grass&mdash;a power of
stomach which our graziers may thank their stars that
their oxen are not endowed with. A probable proximate
cause for this voracity in the case of herbivorous
larv√¶ has been assigned by John Hunter, who attributes
it to the circumstance of their stomach not having the
power of dissolving the vegetable matters received into
it, but merely of extracting from them a juice<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>. This is
proved both by their excrement, which consists of coiled-up
and hardened particles of leaf, that being put into
water expand like tea; and by the great proportion
which the excrement bears to the quantity of food consumed.
From experiments, with a detail of which he
has favoured me, made by Colonel Machell on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
caterpillars of <i>Euprepia Caja</i>, he ascertained that, though
a larva weighing thirty-six grains voided every twelve
hours from fifteen to eighteen grains weight of excrement,
it did not increase in weight in the same period
more than one or two grains. On the other hand, many
carnivorous larv√¶ increase in weight in full proportion
to the food consumed, and that in an astonishing degree.
Redi found that the maggots of flesh-flies, of which one
day, twenty-five or thirty did not weigh above a grain,
the next weighed seven grains each; having thus in
twenty-four hours become about two hundred times
heavier than before<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>.</p>

<p>Some insects have the faculty of sustaining a long abstinence
from all kinds of food. This seems to depend
upon the nature of their habits. If the insect feeds on
a substance of a deficiency of which there is not much
probability, as on vegetables, &amp;c. it commonly requires
a frequent supply. If, on the contrary, it is an insect of
prey, and exposed to the danger of being long deprived
of its food, it is often endowed with a power of fasting,
which would be incredible but for the numerous facts by
which it is authenticated. The ant-lion will exist without
the smallest supply of food, apparently uninjured, for
six months; though, when it can get it, it will devour
daily an insect of its own size. Vaillant, whose authority
may be here taken, assures us that he kept a spider
without food under a sealed glass for ten months, at the
end of which time, though shrunk in size, it was as vigorous
as ever<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>. And Mr. Baker, so well known for his
microscopical discoveries, states that he kept a darkling
beetle (<i>Blaps mortisaga</i>) alive for three years without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
food of any kind<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>. Some insects, not of a predaceous
description, are gifted with a similar power of abstinence.
Leeuwenhoek tells us that a mite, which he had gummed
alive to the point of a needle and placed before his microscope,
lived in that situation eleven weeks<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases the very want of food, however paradoxical
the proposition, seems actually to be a mean of
prolonging the life of insects. At least one such instance
has fallen under my own observation. The aphidivorous
flies, such as <i>Syrphus Pyrastri</i>, &amp;c. live in the larva state
ten or twelve days, in the pupa state about a fortnight,
and as perfect insects sometimes possibly as long&mdash;the
whole term of their existence in summer not exceeding
at the very utmost six weeks. But one<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>, which I put
under a glass on the 2d of June, 1811, when about half
grown, and, after supplying it with Aphides once or twice,
by accident forgot, I found to my great astonishment
alive three months after; and it actually lived until the
June following without a particle of food. It had therefore
existed in the larva state more than eight times as
long as it would have lived in all its states, if it had regularly
undergone its metamorphoses&mdash;which is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
extraordinary a prolongation of life as if a man were to live
560 years. It is true that its existence was not worth
having even to the larva of a fly. For the last eight
months it remained without motion, attached by its posterior
pair of tubercles to the paper on which it was placed,
manifesting no other symptoms of life than by moving the
fore part of the body when touched, and replacing itself
on its belly if turned upon its back. But this was quite
enough to prove it still alive.&mdash;I can attribute this singular
result to no other circumstance than its having been
deprived of a sufficient quantity of food to bring it into
the pupa state, though provided with enough for the attainment
of nearly its full growth as larva. Possibly the
same remote cause might act in this case, as operates to
prolong the term of existence of annual plants that have
been prevented from perfecting their seed; and it would
almost seem to favour the hypothesis of some physiologists,
who contend that every organised being has a certain
portion of irritability originally imparted to it, and
that its life will be long or short as this is slowly or rapidly
excited&mdash;no great consolation this for the advocates
for fast-living, unless they are in good earnest in their
affected preference of a "short life and a merry one:"
though it must be admitted that they would have the best
of the argument were the alternative such a state of torpid
insensibility as that with which our larva purchased the
prolongation of its existence.</p>

<p>After this general view of the food of insects, and of
circumstances connected with it, I proceed to give you
an account of some peculiarities in their modes of procuring
it.</p>

<p>The vegetable feeders have for the most part but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
difficulty in supplying their wants. In the larva state
they generally find themselves placed by the parent insect
upon the very plant or substance which is to nourish
them: and in their perfect state their wings or feet afford
a ready conveyance to the banquet to which by an unerring
sense they are directed. All nature lies before
them, and it is only when their numbers are extraordinarily
increased, or in consequence of some unusual
destruction of their appropriate aliment, that they perish
for want. The description of their food renders unnecessary
those artifices to which many of the carnivorous
insects are obliged to have recourse: and none of them,
if we except the white-ants, whose cunning mode of insinuating
themselves into houses in tropical climates has
been detailed in a former letter, can be said to use stratagem
in obtaining their food.</p>

<p>Of the carnivorous species, the greater proportion attack
their prey by open violence, such as the predaceous
beetles, the Ichneumons, burrowing wasps, and true
wasps; the praying insects (<i>Mantis</i>); the bugs (<i>Geocoris√¶</i>
Latr.); dragon-flies (<i>Libellulina</i>), &amp;c.; which
have been before adverted to. But a very considerable
number, chiefly, however, of one tribe, that of spiders,
provide their sustenance solely by artifice and stratagem,
the singularity of which, and the admirable adaptation
of the instruments by which they take their prey to the
end in view, afford a most wonderful instance of the
power and wisdom of the Creator, and have attracted
admiration in all ages. A description of these, however,
which will require a detailed survey, I must refer to
another letter.</p>

<h3><i>FOOD OF INSECTS CONTINUED.</i></h3>

<h5>STRATAGEMS EMPLOYED IN PROCURING IT.</h5>


<p>The <i>stratagems</i> of insects in obtaining their food are
now to engage our attention. I shall not dwell on those
inartificial modes of surprising their prey, of which examples
may be found amongst almost every order of
insects, such as watching behind a leaf or other object
affording concealment until its approach; but shall proceed
to describe the various artifices of the race of spiders,
of which there are several hundred distinct species
differing essentially from each other both in characters
and manners.</p>

<p>Many of these are constantly under our eyes; and
were it not that we are accustomed to neglect what is
the subject of daily occurrence, we should never behold
a spider's web without astonishment. What, if we had
not witnessed it, would seem more incredible than that
any animal should spin threads; weave these threads
into nets more admirable than ever fowler or fisherman
fabricated; suspend them with the nicest judgement in
the place most abounding in the wished-for prey; and
there concealed watch patiently its approach? In this
case, as in so many others, we neglect actions in minute
animals, which in the larger would excite our endless
admiration. How would the world crowd to see a fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
which should spin ropes, weave them into an accurately-meshed
net, and extend this net between two trees for the
purpose of entangling a flight of birds? Or should we
think we had ever expressed sufficient wonder at seeing
a fish which obtained its prey by a similar contrivance?
Yet there would, in reality, be nothing more marvellous
in their procedures than in those of spiders, which, indeed,
the minuteness of the agent renders more wonderful.</p>

<p>All spiders do not spin webs. A considerable number
adopt other means for catching insects. Of these I
shall speak hereafter. At present I shall endeavour to
give you a clear idea of the operations of the <i>weavers</i>,
explaining successively the instruments by which they
spin&mdash;the mode of forming their nets, together with the
various descriptions of them&mdash;and the manner in which
they entrap and secure their prey.</p>

<p>The thread spun by spiders is in substance similar to
the silk of the silk-worm and other caterpillars, but of a
much finer quality. As in them, it proceeds from reservoirs,
into which it is secreted in the form of a viscid
gum: but in the mode of its extrication is very dissimilar,
issuing not from the mouth but the hinder part of
the abdomen. If you examine a spider, you will perceive
in this part four or six little teat-like protuberances
or spinners. These are the machinery through which,
by a process more singular than that of rope-spinning,
the thread is drawn. Each spinner is furnished with a
multitude of tubes, so numerous and so exquisitely fine,
that a space often not much bigger than the pointed end
of a pin, is furnished, according to Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
thousand of them. From each of these tubes, consisting
of two pieces, the last of which terminates in a point infinitely
fine, proceeds a thread of inconceivable tenuity,
which, immediately after issuing from it, unites with all
the other threads into one. Hence from each spinner
proceeds a compound thread; and these four threads, at
the distance of about one-tenth of an inch from the apex
of the spinners, again unite, and form the thread we are
accustomed to see, which the spider uses in forming its
web. The threads, however, are not all of the same
thickness, for Leeuwenhoek observed that some of the
tubes were larger than others, and furnished a larger
thread. Thus a spider's thread, even spun by the smallest
species, and when so fine that it is almost imperceptible
to our senses, is not, as we suppose, a single line,
but a rope composed of at least four thousand strands.
How astonishing! But to feel all the wonder of this fact
we must follow Leeuwenhoek in one of his calculations
on the subject. This renowned microscopic observer
found by an accurate estimation that the threads of the
minutest spiders, some of which are not larger than a
grain of sand, are so fine that four millions of them would
not equal in thickness one of the hairs of his beard. Of
such tenuity it is utterly beyond the power of the imagination
to conceive: the very idea overwhelms our faculties,
and humbles us under a sense of their imperfection.&mdash;Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
the probable accuracy of this calculation you
may any day in summer convince yourself, by taking
one of the large field spiders (<i>Epeira Diadema</i>), and
after pressing its abdomen against a leaf or other substance,
so as to attach the threads to the surface&mdash;the
same preliminary step which the spider adopts in spinning&mdash;drawing
it gradually to a small distance. You
will plainly perceive that the proper thread of the spider
is formed of four smaller threads, and these again of
threads so fine and numerous, that there cannot be fewer
than a thousand issue from each spinner; and if you
pursue your researches with the microscope, you will
find that precisely the same takes place in the minutest
species that spins.&mdash;You will inquire what can be the end
of machinery so complex? One probable reason is, that
it was necessary for drying the gum sufficiently to form
a tenacious line, that an extensive surface should be exposed
to the air; which is admirably effected by dividing
it at its exit from the abdomen into such numerous
threads. But the chief cause, perhaps, is the occasion
(hereafter to be adverted to) which the spider sometimes
has to employ its threads in their finer and unconnected
state before they unite to form a single one.&mdash;The spider
is gifted by her Creator with the power of closing the
orifices of the spinners at pleasure, and can thus, in
dropping from a height by her line, stop her progress at
any point of her descent: and, according to Lister<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>, she
is also able to retract her threads within the abdomen; but
this is doubted, and with apparent reason, by De Geer<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>.</p>

<p>The only other instruments employed by the spider
in weaving are her feet, with the claws of which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
usually guides, or keeps separated into two or more, the
line from behind; and in many species these are admirably
adapted for the purpose, two of them being furnished
underneath with teeth like those of a comb, by
means of which the threads are kept asunder. But another
instrument was wanting. The spider in ascending
the line by which she has dropped herself from an eminence,
winds up the superfluous cord into a ball. In
performing this the pectinated claws would not have been
suitable. She is therefore furnished with a <i>third</i> claw
between the other two<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>, and is thus provided for every
occasion.</p>

<p>The situations in which spiders place their nets are
as various as their construction. Some prefer the open
air, and suspend them in the midst of shrubs or plants
most frequented by flies and other small insects, fixing
them in a horizontal, a vertical, or an oblique direction.
Others select the corners of windows and of rooms,
where prey always abounds; while many establish themselves
in stables and neglected out-houses, and even in
cellars and desolate places in which one would scarcely
expect a fly to be caught in a month. It is with the
operations of these last especially, that we are accustomed
to associate the ideas of neglect and desertion by
man&mdash;associations which both in painting and allegory
have been often happily applied. Hogarth, when he
wished to produce a speaking picture of neglected charity,
clothed the poor's box in one of his pieces with a
spider's web: and the Jews, in one of the fables with
which they have disfigured the records of holy writ, have
not less ingeniously availed themselves of the same idea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
They relate that the reason why Saul did not discover
David and his men in the cave of Adullam<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> was, that
God had sent a spider which had quickly woven a web
across the entrance of the cave in which they were concealed;
which being observed by Saul, he thought it
useless to investigate further a spot bearing such evident
proofs of the absence of any human being<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>.</p>

<p>The most incurious observer must have remarked the
great difference which exists in the construction of spiders'
webs. Those which we most commonly see in
houses are of a woven texture similar to fine gauze, and
are appropriately termed webs; while those most frequently
met with in the fields are composed of a series of
concentric circles united by <i>radii</i> diverging from the
centre, the threads being remote from each other. These
last, which in their simple state, or still more when
studded with dew drops, you must have a thousand
times admired, are with greater propriety termed <i>nets</i>;
and the insects which form them proceeding on geometrical
principles may be called <i>geometricians</i>, while the
former can aspire only to the humbler denomination of
<i>weavers</i>. I shall endeavour to describe the process followed
in the construction of both, beginning with the
latter.</p>

<p>The weaving spider which is found in houses, having
selected some corner for the site of her web, and determined
its extent, presses her spinners against one of
the walls, and thus glues to it one end of her thread.
She then walks along the wall to the opposite side, and
there in like manner fastens the other end. This thread,
which is to form the outer margin or selvage of her web,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
and requires strength, she triples or quadruples by a repetition
of the operation just described; and from it she
draws other threads in various directions, the interstices
of which she fills up by running from one to the other,
and connecting them by new threads until the whole has
assumed the gauze-like texture which we see. Books of
natural history, all copying from one another, have described
these kinds of web as fabricated of a regular
warp and woof, or of parallel longitudinal lines crossed
at right angles by transverse ones glued to them at the
points of intersection. This, however, is clearly erroneous,
as you will see by the slightest examination of a
web of this kind, in which no such regularity of texture
can be discovered.</p>

<p>The webs just described present merely a simple horizontal
surface, but others more frequently seen in outhouses
and amongst bushes possess a very artificial appendage.
Besides the main web, the spider carries up
from its edges and surface a number of single threads
often to the height of many feet, joining and crossing
each other in various directions. Across these lines,
which may be compared to the tackling of a ship, flies
seem unable to avoid directing their flight. The certain
consequence is, that in striking against these ropes they
become slightly entangled, and, in their endeavours to
disengage themselves, rarely escape being precipitated
into the net spread underneath for their reception, where
their doom is inevitable.</p>

<p>But the net is still incomplete. It is necessary that
our hunter should conceal her grim visage from the
game for which she lies in wait. She does not therefore
station herself upon the surface of her net, but in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
small silken apartment constructed below it, and completely
hidden from view. "In this corner," to use the
quaint translation of Pliny by Philemon Holland, Doctor
in Physic<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>, "with what subtiltie doth she retire making
semblance as though she meant nothing less than that
she doth, and as if she went about some other business!
nay, how close lieth she, that it is impossible to see
whether any one be within or no!" But thus removed
to a distance from her net and entirely out of sight of it,
how is she to know when her prey is entrapped? For
this difficulty our ingenious weaver has provided. She
has taken care to spin several threads from the edge of
the net to that of her hole, which at once inform her by
their vibrations of the capture of a fly, and serve as a
bridge on which in an instant she can run to secure it.</p>

<p>You will readily conceive that the <i>geometrical</i> spiders,
in forming their concentric circled nets, follow a process
very different from that just described, than which indeed
it is in many respects more curious. As the net is
usually fixed in a perpendicular or somewhat oblique direction,
in an opening between the leaves of some shrub
or plant, it is obvious that round its whole extent will
be required lines to which can be attached those ends of
the <i>radii</i> that are furthest from the centre. Accordingly
the construction of these exterior lines is the spider's first
operation. She seems careless about the shape of the
area which they inclose, well aware that she can as
readily inscribe a circle in a triangle as in a square, and
in this respect she is guided by the distance or proximity
of the points to which she can attach them. She spares
no pains, however, to strengthen and keep them in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
proper degree of tension. With the former view she
composes each line of five or six or even more threads
glued together; and with the latter she fixes to them
from different points a numerous and intricate apparatus
of smaller threads. Having thus completed the foundations
of her snare<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>, she proceeds to fill up the outline.
Attaching a thread to one of the main lines, she walks
along it, guiding it with one of her hind feet that it may
not touch in any part and be prematurely glued, and
crosses over to the opposite side, where by applying her
spinners she firmly fixes it. To the middle of this diagonal
thread, which is to form the centre of her net,
she fixes a second, which in like manner she conveys
and fastens to another part of the lines encircling the
area. Her work now proceeds rapidly. During the
preliminary operations she sometimes rests, as though
her plan required meditation. But no sooner are the
marginal lines of her net firmly stretched, and two or
three radii spun from its centre, than she continues her
labour so quickly and unremittingly that the eye can
scarcely follow her progress. The radii to the number
of about twenty, giving the net the appearance of a
wheel, are speedily finished. She then proceeds to the
centre, quickly turns herself round, and pulls each
thread with her feet to ascertain its strength, breaking
any one that seems defective and replacing it by another.
Next, she glues immediately round the centre five or six
small concentric circles, distant about half a line from
each other, and then four or five larger ones, each separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
by a space of half an inch or more. These last
serve as a sort of temporary scaffolding to walk over,
and to keep the radii properly stretched while she glues
to them the concentric circles that are to remain, which
she now proceeds to construct. Placing herself at the
circumference, and fastening her thread to the end of
one of the radii, she walks up that one, towards the
centre, to such a distance as to draw the thread from
her body of a sufficient length to reach to the next. Then
stepping across and conducting the thread with one of
her hind feet, she glues it with her spinners to the point
in the adjoining radius to which it is to be fixed. This
process she repeats until she has filled up nearly the
whole space from the circumference to the centre with
concentric circles distant from each other about two
lines. She always, however, leaves a vacant interval
around the smallest first spun circles that are nearest to
the centre, but for what end I am unable to conjecture.
Lastly, she runs to the centre and bites away the small
cotton-like tuft that united all the radii, which being
now held together by the circular threads have thus
probably their elasticity increased; and in the circular
opening resulting from this procedure she takes her station
and watches for her prey.</p>

<p>In the above description, which is from my own observations,
I have supposed the spider to fix the first
and main line of her net to points from one of which she
could readily climb to the other, dragging it after her;
and many of these nets are placed in situations where
this is very practicable. They are frequently, however,
stretched in places where it is quite impossible for the
spider thus to convey her main line&mdash;between the branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
of lofty trees having no connection with each other; between
two distinct and elevated buildings; and even between
plants growing in water. Here then a difficulty
occurs. How does the spider contrive to extend her
main line, which is often many feet in length, across inaccessible
openings of this description?</p>

<p>With the view of deciding this question, to which I
could find no very satisfactory answer in books, I made
an experiment, for the idea of which I am indebted to a
similar one recorded by Mr. Knight<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>, who informs us
that if a spider be placed upon an upright stick having
its bottom immersed in water, it will, after trying in vain
all other modes of escape, dart out numerous fine threads
so light as to float in the air, some one of which attaching
itself to a neighbouring object furnishes a bridge for
its escape. It was clear that if this mode is pursued by
the geometric spiders, it would go considerably towards
furnishing a solution of the difficulty in question. I accordingly
placed the large field spider (<i>Epeira Diadema</i>)
upon a stick about a foot long, set upright in a vessel
containing water. After fastening its thread (as all spiders
do before they move) at the top of the stick, it
crept down the side until it felt the water with its fore
feet, which seem to serve as antenn√¶: it then immediately
swung itself from the stick (which was slightly bent)
and climbed up by the thread to the top. This it repeated
perhaps a score times, sometimes creeping down
a different part of the stick, but more frequently down
the very side it had so often traversed in vain. Wearied
with this sameness in its operations, I left the room for
some hours. On my return I was surprised to find my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
prisoner escaped, and not a little pleased to discover, on
further examination, a thread extended from the top
of the stick to a cabinet seven or eight inches distant,
which thread had doubtless served as its bridge. Eager
to witness the process by which the line was constructed,
I replaced the spider in its former position. After frequently
creeping down and mounting up again as before,
at length it let itself drop from the top of the stick, not
as before by a single thread, but by <i>two</i>, each distant from
the other about the twelfth of an inch, guided as usual
by one of its hind feet, and one apparently smaller than
the other. When it had suffered itself to descend nearly
to the surface of the water, it stopped short, and, by some
means which I could not distinctly see, broke off close
to the spinners the smallest thread, which still adhering
by the other end to the top of the stick floated in the
air, and was so light as to be carried about by the slightest
breath. On approaching a pencil to the loose end
of this line, it did not adhere from mere contact. I
therefore twisted it once or twice round the pencil, and
then drew it tight. The spider, which had previously
climbed to the top of the stick, immediately pulled at it
with one of its feet, and, finding it sufficiently tense, crept
along it, strengthening it as it proceeded by another
thread, and thus reached the pencil<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>That this therefore is one mode by which the geometric
spiders convey the main line of their nets between
distant objects, there can be no doubt, but that it is the
<i>only</i> one is not so clear. If the position of the main line
be thus determined by the accidental influence of the
wind, we might expect to see these nets arranged with
great irregularity, and crossing each other in every direction;
yet it is the fact, that however closely crowded
they may be, they constantly appear to be placed not
by accident but design, commonly running parallel with
each other at right angles with the points of support, and
never interfering. Another objection too presents itself.
From the experiment related, it is clear that the main
line of the net can never be longer than the height of
the object from which the spider dropped in forming it.
But it is no uncommon thing to see nets in which these
lines are a yard or two long, fastened to twigs of grass
not a foot in height, and yet separated by obstacles effectually
precluding the possibility of the spiders having
<i>dragged</i> the lines from one to the other. Here therefore
some other process must have been used.</p>

<p>Both these difficulties would be removed by adopting
the explanation of an anonymous author in the <i>Journal
de Physique</i><a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>, founded as he asserts on actual observation.
He says that he saw a small spider, which he had
forced to suspend itself by its thread from the point of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
feather, shoot out obliquely in opposite directions other
smaller threads, which attached themselves in the still air
of a room, without any influence of the wind, to the objects
towards which they were directed. He therefore
infers that spiders have the power of shooting out
threads and directing them at pleasure towards a determined
point, judging of the distance and position of
the object by some sense of which we are ignorant.
Something like this man&#339;uvre I once myself witnessed
in a male of the small garden spider (<i>Epeira? reticulata</i>).
It was standing midway on a long perpendicular fixed
thread, and an appearance caught my eye of what seemed
to be the emission of threads from its projected spinners.
I therefore moved my arm in the direction in which they
apparently proceeded, and, as I suspected, a floating
thread attached itself to my coat, along which the spider
crept. As this was connected with the spinners of the
spider, it could not have been formed in the same way
with the secondary thread of <i>E. Diadema</i> above described.</p>

<p>Probably in this case, as in so many others, we bewilder
ourselves by attempting to make nature bend to
generalities to which she disdains to submit. Different
spiders may lay the foundations of their net in a different
manner; some on the plan adopted by <i>E. Diadema</i>;
others, as Lister long ago conjectured<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>, by shooting out
threads in the mode of the flying species, as in the instances
recorded by the anonymous observer, and Mr.
Knight. Nor is it improbable that the same species has
the power of varying its procedures according to circumstances.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>
<p>How far these suppositions are correct it is impossible
to determine without further experiments, which it is
somewhat strange should not before now have been instituted.
Pliny thought it nothing to the credit of the
philosophers of his day, that while they were disputing
about the number of heroes of the name of Hercules,
and the site of the sepulchre of Bacchus, they should not
have decided whether the queen bee had a sting or not<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>;
but it seems much more discreditable to the entomologists
of ours, that they should yet be ignorant how the
geometric spiders fix their nets. One excuse for them
is, that these insects generally begin their operations in
the night, so that, though it is very easy to see them
spinning their concentric circles, it is seldom that they
can be caught laying the foundations of their snares. Yet
doubtless the lucky moment might be hit by an attentive
observer, and I shall be glad if my attempt to describe
their more ordinary operations should induce you
to aim at signalizing yourself by the discovery. If you
failed in solving every difficulty, you would at least be
rewarded by witnessing their industry, ingenuity, and
patience.</p>

<p>For the latter virtue they have no small occasion. Incapable
of actively pursuing their prey, they are dependent
upon what chance conducts into their toils, which,
especially those spread in neglected buildings, often remain
for a long period empty. Even the geometrical
spiders, which fix themselves in the midst of a well-peopled
district in the open air, have frequently to sustain
a protracted abstinence. A continued storm of wind
and rain will demolish their nets, and preclude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
possibility of reconstructing them for many days or sometimes
weeks, during which not a single gnat regales their
sharp-set appetites. And when at length formed anew
or repaired, an unlucky bee or wasp, or an overgrown
fly, will perversely entangle itself in toils not intended
for insects of its bulk, and in disengaging itself once
more leave the net in ruin.&mdash;All these trials move not
our philosophic race. They patiently sit in their watching-place
in the same posture, scarcely ever stirring but
when the expected prey appears. And however repeatedly
their nets are injured or destroyed, as long as their
store of silk is unexhausted, they repair or reconstruct
them without loss of time.</p>

<p>The web of a house spider will, with occasional repairs,
serve for a considerable period; but the nets of
the geometric spiders are in favourable weather renewed
either wholly, or at least their concentric circles, every
twenty-four hours, even when not apparently injured.
This difference in the operations of the two tribes depends
upon a very remarkable peculiarity in the conformation
of their snares. The threads of the house
spider's web are all of the same kind of silk, and flies
are caught in them from their claws becoming entangled
in the fine meshes which form the texture. On the other
hand the net of the garden spider is composed of two
distinct kinds of silk; that of the radii not adhesive, that
of the circles extremely viscid<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>. The cause of this difference,
which, when it is considered that both sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
silk proceed from the same instrument, is truly wonderful,
may be readily perceived. If you examine a newly
formed net with a microscope, you will find that the
threads composing the outline and the radii are simple,
those of the circles closely studded with minute dew-like
globules, which from the elasticity of the thread are easily
separable from each other. That these are in fact globules
of viscid gum, is proved by their adhering to the
finger and retaining dust thrown upon the net, while the
unadhesive radii and exterior threads remain unsoiled.
It is these gummed threads alone which retain the insects
that fly into the net; and as they lose their viscid
properties by the action of the air, it is necessary that
they should be frequently renewed.</p>

<p>In this renewal, as above hinted, the geometrical spiders
are constantly regulated by the future probable
state of the atmosphere, of which they have such a nice
perception, that M. Q. D'Isjonval, to whom we are indebted
for the fact, has proposed them as most accurate
barometers. He asserts that if the weather be about to
be variable, wet and stormy, the main threads which support
the net will be certainly short; but if fine settled
weather be on the point of commencing, these threads
will be as invariably very long<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>. Without going the
length with M. D'Isjonval of deeming his discoveries
important enough to regulate the march of armies, or
the sailing of fleets, or of proposing that the first appearance
of these barometrical spiders in spring should be
announced by the sound of trumpet, I have reason to
suppose from my own observations that his statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
are in the main accurate, and that a very good idea of
the weather may be formed from attending to these
insects.</p>

<p>The spiders which form geometrical nets differ from
the weavers also with respect to the situation in which
they watch for their prey. They do not conceal themselves
under their net, but are placed in the centre with
their head downwards, and retire to a little apartment
formed on one side under some leaf of a plant, only when
obliged by danger or the state of the weather. The moment
an unfortunate fly or other insect touches the net,
the spider rushes towards it, seizes it with her fangs, and
if it be a small species at once carries it to her little cell,
and, having there at leisure sucked its juices, throws out
the carcase. If the insect be larger and struggle to escape,
with surprising address she envelops it with threads in
various directions, until both its wings and legs being
effectually fastened, she carries it off to her den. If the
captured insect be a bee or a large fly so strong that the
spider is sensible it is more than a match for her, she
never attempts to seize or even entangle it, but on the
contrary assists it to disengage itself, and often breaks off
that part of the net to which it hangs, content to be rid
of such an unmanageable intruder at any price.&mdash;When
larger booty is plentiful, these spiders seem not to regard
smaller insects. I have observed them in autumn, when
their nets were almost covered with the Aphides which
filled the air, impatiently pulling them off and dropping
them untouched over the sides, as though irritated that
their meshes should be occupied with such insignificant
game.&mdash;A species of spider described by Lister, (<i>Epeira
conica</i>,) more provident than its brethren, suspends its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
prey in the meshes above and below the centre, and it
is not uncommon to see its larder thus stored with several
flies<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>.</p>

<p>You must not infer that the toils of spiders are in every
part of the world formed of such fragile materials as those
which we are accustomed to see, or that they are every
where contented with small insects for their food. An
author in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> asserts, that the
spiders of Bermudas spin webs between trees seven and
eight fathoms distant, which are strong enough to ensnare
a bird as large as a thrush<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>. And Sir G. Staunton
informs us, that in the forests of Java, spiders' webs
are met with of so strong a texture as to require a sharp-cutting
instrument to make way through them<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor must you suppose that all the spiders of this country
which catch their prey by means of snares, follow
the same plan in constructing them as the weavers and
geometricians whose operations I have endeavoured to
describe. The form of their snares and the situation in
which they place them are so various, that it is impossible
to enumerate more than a few of the most remarkable.
<i>Agelene labyrinthica</i> extends over the blades of
grass a large white horizontal net having at its margin a
cylindrical cell, in the bottom of which, secure from birds
and defended from the rays of the sun, the spider lies
concealed, whence on the slightest movement of her net
she rushes out upon her prey. <i>Aranea latens</i>, F. conceals
itself under a small net spun upon the upper surface of
a leaf, and thence seizes upon any insect that chances to
pass over it. <i>Theridium</i> 13-<i>guttatum</i> forms under stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
and in slight furrows in the ground a net consisting of
threads spun without any regularity in all directions,
but so strong as to entrap grasshoppers, which are said
to be its principal food; and a similar inartificial snare
of simple threads is often spun in windows by <i>Theridium
bipunctatum</i> and several other species. <i>Segestria senoculata</i>
and its affinities conceal themselves in a long cylindrical
straight silken tube, from the mouth of which they
stretch out their six anterior feet, whose extremities rest
upon as many diverging threads: thus, as soon as an
insect walks across any of the threads (which are eight
or ten inches long) the insect's toes give it warning of
prey being at hand, when it rushes out and seldom fails
to secure its victim.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The spider's touch how exquisitely fine!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Feels at each thread, and lives along the line."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>M. Homberg tells us that he has seen a vigorous wasp
carried off and destroyed by one of these species.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The spiders, to which I have hitherto adverted, seize
their prey by means of webs or nets; but a very large
number, though, like the former, they spin silken cocoons
for containing their eggs, never employ the same
material in constructing similar snares, of which they
make no use.</p>

<p>These may be separated into two grand divisions: the
first comprising those which conceal themselves and lie
in ambuscade for their prey, and sometimes run after it
to a short distance; the second, those which are constantly
roaming about in every direction in search of it,
and seize it by open violence. The former Walckenaer,
in his admirable work on spiders, has designated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
name of <i>Vagrants</i>, the latter by that of <i>Hunters</i>; terming
those already mentioned which spin webs and nets,
<i>Sedentaries</i>: if to these you add the <i>Swimmers</i>, or those
species which catch their prey in the water, you will
have an idea of the general manners of the whole race of
spiders.</p>

<p>The artifices of that tribe which Walckenaer has
named vagrants are various and singular. <i>Clubiona holosericea</i>
and many other species conceal themselves in
a little cell formed of the rolled-up leaf of a plant, and
thence dart upon any insect which chances to pass;
while <i>C. atrox</i> and its affinities select for their place
of ambush a hole in a wall, or lurk behind a stone, or in
the bark of a tree. <i>Aranea calycina</i>, L. more ingeniously
places herself at the bottom of the calyx of a dead flower,
and pounces upon the unwary flies that come in search
of honey; and <i>A. arundinacea</i> buries herself in the thick
panicle of a reed, and seizes the luckless visitors enticed
to rest upon her silvery concealment. Many of this
tribe at times quit their habitations, and by various stratagems
contrive to come within reach of their prey, as
by pretending to be dead, hiding themselves behind any
slight projection, &amp;c. A white species I have often observed
squatted in the blossom of the hawthorn or on
the flowers of umbelliferous plants, and is thus effectually
concealed by the similarity of colour.</p>

<p>Foremost amongst the spiders comprehended by
Walckenaer under the general name of hunters, which
search after and openly seize their prey, must be enumerated
the monstrous <i>Mygale avicularia</i>, at least two
inches long, which takes up its abode in the woods of
South America, and has been reputed to seize and devour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
even small birds; but this is wholly denied by
Langsdorf, who declares that it eats only insects<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>. This
species, as well as another tropical one, <i>Thomisus venatorius</i>,
the European <i>Cteniza cementaria</i>, and many
others, construct in the ground very singular cylindrical
cavities, and therein carry and devour their prey. These,
being rather the habitations of insects than snares, I
shall describe in a subsequent letter. <i>Lycosa saccata</i>,
the species whose affection for its young I have before
detailed, and not a few others of the same family, common
in this country, in like manner seize their prey
openly, and when caught carry it to little inartificial cavities
under stones. <i>Dolomedes fimbriatus</i> hunts along
the margins of pools; and <i>Lycosa piratica</i> and its congeners
not only chase their prey in the same situation,
but, venturing to skate upon the surface of the water
itself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... bathe unwet their oily forms, and dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With feet repulsive on the dimpling well."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Rev. R. Sheppard has often noticed in the fen
ditches of Norfolk a very large spider which actually
forms a <i>raft</i> for the purpose of obtaining its prey with
more facility. Keeping its station upon a ball of weeds
about three inches in diameter, probably held together
by slight silken cords, it is wafted along the surface of
the water upon this floating island, which it quits the
moment it sees a drowning insect,&mdash;not, as you may conceive,
for the sake of applying to it the process of the
Humane Society, but of hastening its exit by a more
speedy engine of destruction. The booty thus seized it
devours at leisure upon its raft, under which it retires
when alarmed by any danger.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>
<p>The last of the tribe of hunters that it is necessary to
particularize, are those which, like the tigers amongst
the larger animals, seize their victims by leaping upon
them. To this division belongs a very pretty small
banded species, <i>Salticus scenicus</i>, which in summer may
be seen running on every wall.</p>

<p>To Walckenaer's <i>swimmers</i>, the last of his grand
tribes of spiders, including <i>Argyroneta aquatica</i>, &amp;c., the
first line of the above quotation from Dr. Darwin is particularly
applicable; for these actually seize their food by
diving under the water, their bodies being kept unwet
by a coating of air which constantly surrounds them.&mdash;Thus
one single race of insects exemplify in miniature
almost all the modes of obtaining food which prevail
amongst predaceous quadrupeds&mdash;the audacious attack
of the lion; the wily spring of the tiger; the sedentary
cunning of the lynx; and the amphibious dexterity of
the otter.</p>

<p>This general view of the stratagems by which the
spider tribe obtain their food, imperfect as it is, will, I
trust, have interested you sufficiently to drive away the
associations of disgust with which you, like almost every
one else, have probably been accustomed to regard these
insects. Instead of considering them as repulsive compounds
of cruelty and ferocity, you will henceforward
see in their procedures only the ingenious contrivance of
patient and industrious hunters, who while obeying the
great law of nature in procuring their sustenance, are actively
serviceable to the human race in destroying noxious
insects. You will allow the poet to stigmatize them as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... cunning and fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mixture abhorred!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but you will see that these epithets are in reality as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
unjustly applied to them (at least with reference to the
mode in which they procure their necessary subsistence)
as to the patient sportsman who lays snares for the birds
that are to serve for the dinner of his family; and when
you hear</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... the fluttering wing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And shriller sound declare extreme distress,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>you will as little think it the part of true mercy to stretch
forth "the helping hospitable hand" to the entrapped fly
as to the captive birds. The spider requires his meal as
well as the Indian: and, however to our weak capacity
the great law of creation "eat or be eaten" may seem
cruel or unnecessary, knowing as we do that it is the
ordinance of a beneficent Being, who does all things
well, and that in fact the sum of happiness is greatly
augmented by it, no man, who does not let a morbid
sensibility get the better of his judgement, will, on account
of their subjection to this rule, look upon predaceous
animals with abhorrence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more instance of the stratagems of insects in procuring
their prey shall conclude this letter. Other examples
might be adduced, but the enumeration would
be tedious. This, from an order of insects widely differing
from that which includes the race of spiders, is
perhaps more curious and interesting than any of those
hitherto recited. The insect to which I allude, an inhabitant
of the south of Europe, is the larva of a species
of ant-lion (<i>Myrmeleon</i>), so called from its singular manners
in this state. It belongs to a genus between the
dragon-fly and the Hemerobius. When full grown its
length is about half an inch: in shape it has a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
resemblance to a wood-louse, but the outline of the body
is more triangular, the anterior part being considerably
wider than the posterior: it has six legs, and the mouth
is furnished with a forceps consisting of two incurved
jaws, which give it a formidable appearance<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>. If we
looked only at its external conformation and habits, we
should be apt to conclude it one of the most helpless animals
in the creation. Its sole food is the juices of other
insects, particularly ants, but at the first view it seems
impossible that it should ever secure a single meal. Not
only is its pace slow, but it can walk in no other direction
than <i>backwards</i>; you may judge, therefore, what
would be such a hunter's chance of seizing an active ant.
Nor would a stationary posture be more favourable; for
its grim aspect would infallibly impress upon all wanderers
the prudence of keeping at a respectful distance.
What then is to become of our poor ant-lion? In its appetite
it is a perfect epicure, never, however great may
be its hunger, deigning to taste of a carcase unless it has
previously had the enjoyment of killing it; and then extracting
only the finer juices. In what possible way can
it contrive to supply such a succession of delicacies, when
its ordinary habits seem to unfit it for obtaining even the
coarsest provision? You shall hear. It accomplishes by
artifice what all its open efforts would have been unequal
to. It digs in loose sand a conical pit, in the bottom of
which it conceals itself, and there seizes upon the insects
which, chancing to stumble over the margin, are precipitated
down the sides to the centre. "How wonderful!"
you exclaim: but you will be still more surprised when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
I have described the whole process by which it excavates
its trap, and the ingenious contrivances to which it has
recourse.</p>

<p>Its first concern is to find a soil of loose dry sand, in
the neighbourhood of which, indeed, its provident mother
has previously taken care to place it, and in a sheltered
spot near an old wall, or at the foot of a tree. This
is necessary on two accounts: the prey most acceptable
to it abounds there, and no other soil would suit for the
construction of its snare. Its next step is to trace in the
sand a circle, which, like the furrow with which Romulus
marked out the limits of his new city, is to determine the
extent of its future abode. This being done, it proceeds
to excavate the cavity by throwing out the sand in a
mode not less singular than effective. Placing itself in
the inside of the circle which it has traced, it thrusts the
hind part of its body under the sand, and with one of its
fore-legs, serving as a shovel, it charges its flat and square
head with a load, which it immediately throws over the
outside of the circle with a jerk strong enough to carry it
to the distance of several inches. This little man&#339;uvre
is executed with surprising promptitude and address. A
gardener does not operate so quickly or so well with
his spade and his foot, as the ant-lion with its head and
leg.&mdash;Walking backwards, and constantly repeating the
process, it soon arrives at the part of the circle from
which it set out. It then traces a new one, excavates
another furrow in a similar manner, and by a repetition
of these operations at length arrives at the centre of its
cavity. One circumstance deserves remark&mdash;that it
never loads its head with the sand lying on the <i>outside</i>
of the circle, though it would be as easy to do this with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
the outward leg, as to remove the sand within the circle
by the inner leg. But it knows that it is the sand in the
interior of the circle only that is to be excavated, and it
therefore constantly uses the leg next the centre. It will
readily occur, however, that to use one leg as a shovel
exclusively throughout the whole of such a toilsome operation,
would be extremely wearisome and painful. For
this difficulty our ingenious pioneer has a resource. After
finishing the excavation of one circular furrow, it traces
the next in an opposite direction; and thus alternately
exercises each of its legs without tiring either.</p>

<p>In the course of its labours it frequently meets with
small stones: these it places upon its head one by one,
and jerks over the margin of the pit. But sometimes,
when near the bottom, a pebble presents itself of a size
so large that this process is impossible, its head not
being sufficiently broad and strong to bear so great a
weight, and the height being too considerable to admit
of projecting so large a body to the top. A more impatient
labourer would despair, but not so our insect. A
new plan is adopted. By a man&#339;uvre, not easily described,
it lifts the stone upon its back, keeps it in a
steady position by an alternate motion of the segments
which compose that part; and carefully walking up the
ascent with the burthen, deposits it on the outside of the
margin. When, as occasionally happens, the stone is
round, the labour becomes most difficult and painful.
A spectator watching the motions of the ant-lion feels
an inexpressible interest in its behalf. He sees it with
vast exertion elevate the stone, and begin its arduous
retrograde ascent: at every moment the burthen totters
to one side or the other: the adroit porter lifts up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
segments of its back to balance it, and has already
nearly reached the top of the pit, when a stumble or a
jolt mocks all its efforts, and the stone tumbles headlong
to the bottom. Mortified, but not despairing, the ant-lion
returns to the charge; again replaces the stone, on its
back; again ascends the side, and artfully avails himself,
for a road, of the channel formed by the falling stone,
against the sides of which he can support his load. This
time possibly he succeeds; or it may be, as is often the
case, the stone again rolls down. When thus unfortunate,
our little Sisyphus has been seen six times patiently to
renew his attempt, and was at last, as such heroic resolution
deserved, successful. It is only after a series of
trials have demonstrated the impossibility of succeeding
that our engineer yields to fate, and, quitting his half-excavated
pit, begins the formation of another.</p>

<p>When all obstacles are overcome, and the pit is
finished, it presents itself as a conical hole rather more
than two inches deep, gradually contracting to a point
at the bottom, and about three inches wide at the top<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>.
The ant-lion now takes its station at the bottom of the
pit, and, that its gruff appearance may not scare the
passengers which approach its den, covers itself with
sand all except the points of its expanded forceps. It
is not long before an ant on its travels, fearing no harm,
steps upon the margin of the pit, either accidentally or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
for the purpose of exploring the depth below. Alas! its
curiosity is dearly gratified. The faithless sand slides
from under its feet; its struggles but hasten its descent;
and it is precipitated headlong into the jaws of the concealed
devourer. Sometimes, however, it chances that
the ant is able to stop itself midway, and with all haste
scrambles up again. No sooner does the ant-lion perceive
this, (for, being furnished with six eyes on each
side of his head, he is sufficiently sharp-sighted,) than,
shaking off his inactivity, he hastily shovels loads of sand
upon his head, and vigorously throws them up in quick
succession upon the escaping insect, which, attacked by
such a heavy shower from below and treading on so
unstable a path, is almost inevitably carried to the bottom.
The instant his victim is fairly within reach, the
ant-lion seizes him between his jaws, which are admirable
instruments, at the same time hooked for holding,
and hollow, furnished with a lateral piston, for sucking,
and at his leisure extracting all the juices of the body,
regales upon formic acid. The dry carcase he subsequently
jerks out of his den, that it may not encumber
him in his future contests, or betray the "horrid secrets
of his prison-house:" and if the sides of the pit have
received any damage, he leaves his concealment for
awhile to repair it: which having done, he resumes his
station.</p>

<p>In this manner in its larva state this insect lives nearly
two years, during all which time it receives no food but
what has been caught through the artifice above described.
Though all living insects, for I have fed it with
flies, are equally acceptable to it, as the winged tribe
can easily take flight from its pit should they chance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
fall into it, its prey consists chiefly of apterous species,
of which ants form by far the largest portion, with occasionally
an unwary spider or wood-louse. When the
full period of its growth is attained it retires under the
sand; spins with its anus a silken cocoon; remains a
chrysalis a few weeks; and then breaks forth a four-winged
insect resembling, as before observed, the dragon-fly
both in appearance and manners, and preying in
like manner on moths, butterflies, and other insects<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>.</p>

<p>The larva of <i>Myrmeleon Formicaleo</i> is not the only insect
which avails itself of a trap for obtaining its prey.
A plan in most respects similar is adopted by that of a
fly (<i>Leptis Vermileo</i>) in form somewhat resembling the
common flesh maggot. This also digs a funnel-shaped
cavity in loose earth or sand, but deeper in proportion
to its width than that of <i>M. Formicaleo</i>, and excavated
not by regular circles, but by throwing out the earth
obliquely on all sides. When its trap is finished, it
stretches itself near the bottom, remaining stiff and without
motion like a piece of wood, and the last segment
bent at an angle with the rest, so as to form a strong
point of support in the struggles which it often necessarily
has with vigorous prey. The moment an insect
falls into the pitfall, the larva writhes itself round it like
a serpent, transfixes it with its mandibles, and sucks its
juices at its ease. If the insect escapes, the larva casts
above it jets of sand with surprising rapidity<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XIV" id="LETTER_XIV">LETTER XIV.</a></h2>

<h3><i>HABITATIONS OF INSECTS.</i></h3>


<p>In forming an estimate of the civilization and intellectual
progress of a newly discovered people, we usually
pay attention to their buildings, and other proofs of
architectural skill. If we find them, like the wretched
inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land, without other abodes
than natural caverns or miserable penthouses of bark,
we at once regard them as the most ignorant and unhumanized
of their race. If, like the natives of the
South Sea Isles, they have advanced a step further, and
enjoy houses formed of timber, thatched with leaves,
and furnished with utensils of different kinds, we are
inclined to place them considerably higher in the scale.
When, as in the case of ancient Mexico, we discover a
nation inhabiting towns containing stone houses, regularly
disposed into streets, we do not hesitate without
other inquiry to decide that it must have been civilized
in no ordinary degree. And if it were to chance that
some future Park in Africa should stumble upon the
ruins of a large city, where, in addition to these proofs
of science, every building was constructed on just geometrical
and architectural principles; where the materials
were so employed as to unite strength with lightness,
and a confined site so artfully occupied as to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
spacious symmetrical apartments, we should eagerly inquire
into the history of the inhabitants, and sigh over
the remains of a race whose intellectual advances we
should infer with certainty were not inferior to our own.</p>

<p>Were we by the same test to estimate the sagacity of
the different classes of animals, we should beyond all
doubt assign the highest place to insects, which in the
construction of their habitations leave all the rest far behind.
The nests of birds, from the rook's rude assemblage
of sticks to the pensile dwellings of the tailor-bird,
wonderful as they doubtless are, are indisputably eclipsed
by the structures formed by many insects; and the regular
villages of the beaver, by far the most sagacious
architect amongst quadrupeds, must yield the palm to a
wasp's nest. You will think me here guilty of exaggeration,
and that, blinded by my attachment to a favourite
pursuit, I am elevating the little objects, which I wish to
recommend to your study, to a rank beyond their just
claim. So far, however, am I from being conscious of
any such prejudice, that I do not hesitate to go further,
and assert that the pyramids of Egypt, as the work of
man, are not more wonderful for their size and solidity
than are the structures built by some insects.</p>

<p>To describe the most remarkable of these is my present
object: and that some method may be observed, I
shall in this letter describe the habitations of insects living
in a state of solitude, and built each by a single architect;
and in a subsequent one, those of insects living in societies,
built by the united labours of many. The former
class may be conveniently subdivided into habitations
built by the parent insect, not for its own use, but for the
convenience of its future young; and those which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
formed by the insect that inhabits them for its own accommodation.
To the first I shall now call your attention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The solitary insects which construct habitations for
their future young without any view to their own accommodation,
chiefly belong to the order <i>Hymenoptera</i>, and
are principally different species of wild bees. Of these
the most simple are built by <i>Colletes</i><a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> <i>succincta</i>, <i>fodiens</i>,
&amp;c. The situation which the parent bee chooses, is
either the dry earth of a bank, or the vacuities of stone
walls cemented with earth instead of mortar. Having
excavated a cylinder about two inches in depth, running
usually in a horizontal direction, the bee occupies it with
three or four cells about half an inch long, and one-sixth
broad, shaped like a thimble, the end of one fitting into
the mouth of another. The substance of which these
cells are formed is two or three layers of a silky membrane,
composed of a kind of glue secreted by the animal,
resembling gold-beater's leaf, but much finer, and so thin
and transparent that the colour of an included object
may be seen through them. As soon as one cell is completed,
the bee deposits an egg within, and nearly fills it
with a paste composed of pollen and honey; which having
done, she proceeds to form another cell, storing it in like
manner until the whole is finished, when she carefully
stops up the mouth of the orifice with earth. Our countryman
Grew seems to have found a series of these nests
in a singular situation&mdash;the middle of the pith of an old
elder-branch&mdash;in which they were placed lengthwise one
after another with a thin boundary between each<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>Cells composed of a similar membranaceous substance,
but placed in a different situation, are constructed by
<i>Anthidium manicatum</i><a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>. This gay insect does not excavate
holes for their reception, but places them in the
cavities of old trees, or of any other object that suits its
purpose. Sir Thomas Cullum discovered the nest of
one in the inside of the lock of a garden-gate, in which I
have also since twice found them. It should seem, however,
that such situations would be too cold for the grubs
without a coating of some non-conducting substance.
The parent bee, therefore, after having constructed the
cells, laid an egg in each, and filled them with a store of
suitable food, plasters them with a covering of vermiform
masses, apparently composed of honey and pollen; and
having done this, aware, long before Count Rumford's
experiments, what materials conduct heat most slowly,
she attacks the woolly leaves of <i>Stachys lanata</i>, <i>Agrostemma
coronaria</i>, and similar plants, and with her mandibles
industriously scrapes off the wool, which with her
fore legs she rolls into a little ball and carries to her nest.
This wool she sticks upon the plaster that covers her
cells, and thus closely envelops them with a warm coating
of down impervious to every change of temperature<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>.</p>

<p>The bee last described may be said to exercise the
trade of a clothier. Another numerous family would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
more properly compared to carpenters, boring with incredible
labour out of the solid wood long cylindrical
tubes, and dividing them into various cells. Amongst
these, one of the most remarkable is <i>Xylocopa</i><a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> <i>violacea</i>,
a large species, a native of Southern Europe, distinguished
by beautiful wings of a deep violet colour, and
found commonly in gardens, in the upright putrescent
espaliers or vine-props of which, and occasionally in the
garden seats, doors and window-shutters, she makes
her nest. In the beginning of spring, after repeated and
careful surveys, she fixes upon a piece of wood suitable
for her purpose, and with her strong mandibles begins
the process of boring. First proceeding obliquely downwards,
she soon points her course in a direction parallel
with the sides of the wood, and at length with unwearied
exertion forms a cylindrical hole or tunnel not less than
twelve or fifteen inches long and half an inch broad.
Sometimes, where the diameter will admit of it, three or
four of these pipes, nearly parallel with each other, are
bored in the same piece. Herculean as this task, which
is the labour of several days, appears, it is but a small
part of what our industrious bee cheerfully undertakes.
As yet she has completed but the shell of the destined
habitation of her offspring; each of which, to the number
of ten or twelve, will require a separate and distinct
apartment. How, you will ask, is she to form these?
With what materials can she construct the floors and
ceilings? Why truly <span class="smcap">God</span> "doth instruct her to discretion
and doth teach her." In excavating her tunnel
she has detached a large quantity of fibres, which lie on
the ground like a heap of saw-dust. This material supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
all her wants. Having deposited an egg at the
bottom of the cylinder along with the requisite store of
pollen and honey, she next, at the height of about three
quarters of an inch, (which is the depth of each cell,) constructs
of particles of the saw-dust glued together, and
also to the sides of the tunnel, what may be called an annular
stage or scaffolding. When this is sufficiently
hardened, its interior edge affords support for a second
ring of the same materials, and thus the ceiling is gradually
formed of these concentric circles, till there remains
only a small orifice in its centre, which is also closed with
a circular mass of agglutinated particles of saw-dust.
When this partition, which serves as the ceiling of the
first cell and the flooring of the second, is finished, it is
about the thickness of a crown-piece, and exhibits the
appearance of as many concentric circles as the animal
has made pauses in her labour. One cell being finished,
she proceeds to another, which she furnishes and completes
in the same manner, and so on until she has divided
her whole tunnel into ten or twelve apartments.</p>

<p>Here, if you have followed me in this detail with the
interest which I wish it to inspire, a query will suggest
itself. It will strike you that such a laborious undertaking
as the constructing and furnishing these cells, cannot be
the work of one or even of two days. Considering that
every cell requires a store of honey and pollen, not to be
collected but with long toil, and that a considerable interval
must be spent in agglutinating the floors of each,
it will be very obvious to you that the last egg in the last
cell must be laid many days after the first. We are certain,
therefore, that the first egg will become a grub, and
consequently a perfect bee, many days before the last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
What then becomes of it? you will ask. It is impossible
that it should make its escape through eleven superincumbent
cells without destroying the immature tenants; and
it seems equally impossible that it should remain patiently
in confinement below them until they are all disclosed.
This dilemma our heaven-taught architect has provided
against. With forethought never enough to be admired
she has not constructed her tunnel with one opening only,
but at the further end has pierced <i>another</i> orifice, a kind
of back-door, through which the insects produced by the
first-laid eggs successively emerge into day. In fact, all
the young bees, even the uppermost, go out by this road;
for, by an exquisite instinct, each grub, when about to
become a pupa, places itself in its cell with its head downwards,
and thus is necessitated, when arrived at its last
state, to pierce its cell in this direction<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Ceratina albilabris</i> of Spinola, who has given an interesting
account of its manners, forms its cell upon the
general plan of the bee just described, but, more economical
of labour, chooses a branch of briar or bramble,
in the pith of which she excavates a canal about a foot
long and one line, or sometimes more, in diameter, with
from eight to twelve cells separated from each other by
partitions of particles of pith glued together<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>.</p>

<p>Such are the curious habitations of the carpenter bees.
Next I shall introduce you to the not less interesting
structures of another family which carry on the trade of
masons, (<i>Megachile muraria</i>,) building their solid houses
solely of artificial stone. The first step of the mother bee
is to fix upon a proper situation for the future mansion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
her offspring. For this she usually selects an angle, sheltered
by any projection, on the south side of a stone wall.
Her next care is to provide materials for the structure.
The chief of these is sand, which she carefully selects
grain by grain from such as contains some mixture of
earth. These grains she glues together with her viscid
saliva into masses the size of small shot, and transports
by means of her jaws to the site of her castle<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>. With a
number of these masses, which are the artificial stone of
which her building is to be composed, united by a cement
preferable to ours, she first forms the basis or foundation
of the whole. Next she raises the walls of a cell,
which is about an inch in length and half an inch broad,
and before its orifice is closed in form resembles a thimble.
This, after depositing an egg and a supply of honey
and pollen, she covers in, and then proceeds to the erection
of a second, which she finishes in the same manner,
until the whole number, which varies from four to eight,
is completed. The vacuities between the cells, which
are not placed in any regular order, some being parallel
to the wall, others perpendicular to it, and others inclined
to it at different angles, this laborious architect
fills up with the same material of which the cells are
composed, and then bestows upon the whole group a
common covering of coarser grains of sand. The form
of the whole nest, which when finished is a solid mass
of stone so hard as not to be easily penetrated with the
blade of a knife, is an irregular oblong of the same colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
as the sand, and to a casual observer more resembling
a splash of mud than an artificial structure. These
bees sometimes are more economical of their labour,
and repair old nests, for the possession of which they
have very desperate combats. One would have supposed
that the inhabitants of a castle so fortified might
defy the attacks of every insect marauder. Yet an Ichneumon
and a beetle (<i>Clerus apiarius</i>) both contrive to
introduce their eggs into the cells, and the larv√¶ proceeding
from them devour their inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>.</p>

<p>Other bees of the same family with that last described,
use different materials in the construction of their nests.
Some employ fine earth made into a kind of mortar with
gluten. Another (<i>Osmia</i><a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> <i>c√¶rulescens</i>), as we learn from
De Geer, forms its nest of argillaceous earth mixed with
chalk, upon stone walls, and sometimes probably nidificates
in chalk-pits. <i>O. bicornis</i> selects the hollows of
large stones for the site of its dwelling; while others
prefer the holes in wood.</p>

<p>The works thus far described require in general less
genius than labour and patience: but it is far otherwise
with the nests of the last tribe of artificers amongst wild
bees, to which I shall advert&mdash;the hangers of tapestry,
or upholsterers&mdash;those which line the holes excavated
in the earth for the reception of their young, with an elegant
coating of flowers or of leaves. Amongst the most
interesting of these is <i>Megachile</i><a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> <i>Papaveris</i>, a species
whose manners have been admirably described by Reaumur.
This little bee, as though fascinated with the
colour most attractive to our eyes, invariably chooses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
for the hangings of her apartments the most brilliant
scarlet, selecting for its material the petals of the wild
poppy, which she dexterously cuts into the proper form.
Her first process is to excavate in some pathway a burrow,
cylindrical at the entrance but swelled out below,
to the depth of about three inches. Having polished
the walls of this little apartment, she next flies to a
neighbouring field, cuts out oval portions of the flowers
of poppies, seizes them between her legs and returns with
them to her cell; and though separated from the wrinkled
petal of a half-expanded flower, she knows how to
straighten their folds, and, if too large, to fit them for
her purpose by cutting off the superfluous parts. Beginning
at the bottom, she overlays the walls of her mansion
with this brilliant tapestry, extending it also on the
surface of the ground round the margin of the orifice.
The bottom is rendered warm by three or four coats,
and the sides have never less than two. The little
upholsterer, having completed the hangings of her apartment,
next fills it with pollen and honey to the height of
about half an inch; then, after committing an egg to it,
she wraps over the poppy lining so that even the roof
may be of this material; and lastly closes its mouth with
a small hillock of earth<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>. The great depth of the cell
compared with the space which the single egg and the
accompanying food deposited in it occupy, deserves particular
notice. This is not more than half an inch at the
bottom, the remaining two inches and a half being subsequently
filled with earth.&mdash;When you next favour me
with a visit, I can show you the cells of this interesting
insect as yet unknown to British entomologists, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
I am indebted to the kindness of M. Latreille, who first
scientifically described the species<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>.</p>

<p><i>Megachile centuncularis</i>, <i>M. Willughbiella</i>, and other
species of the same family, like the preceding, cover the
walls of their cells with a coating of leaves, but are content
with a more sober colour, generally selecting for
their hangings the leaves of trees, especially of the rose,
whence they have been known by the name of the <i>leaf-cutter</i>
bees. They differ also from <i>M. Papaveris</i> in excavating
longer burrows, and filling them with several
thimble-shaped cells composed of portions of leaves so
curiously convoluted, that, if we were ignorant in what
school they have been taught to construct them, we
should never credit their being the work of an insect.
Their entertaining history, so long ago as 1670, attracted
the attention of our countrymen Ray, Lister, Willughby,
and Sir Edward King; but we are indebted for the most
complete account of their procedures to Reaumur.</p>

<p>The mother bee first excavates a cylindrical hole
eight or ten inches long, in a horizontal direction, either
in the ground or in the trunk of a rotten willow-tree, or
occasionally in other decaying wood. This cavity she
fills with six or seven cells wholly composed of portions
of leaf, of the shape of a thimble, the convex end of one
closely fitting into the open end of another. Her first
process is to form the exterior coating, which is composed
of three or four pieces of larger dimensions than
the rest, and of an oval form. The second coating is
formed of portions of equal size, narrow at one end but
gradually widening towards the other, where the width
equals half the length. One side of these pieces is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
serrate margin of the leaf from which it was taken, which,
as the pieces are made to lap one over the other, is kept
on the outside, and that which has been cut within. The
little animal now forms a third coating of similar materials,
the middle of which, as the most skilful workman
would do in similar circumstances, she places over the
margins of those that form the first tube, thus covering
and strengthening the junctures. Repeating the same
process, she gives a fourth and sometimes a fifth coating
to her nest, taking care, at the closed end or narrow extremity
of the cell, to bend the leaves so as to form a
convex termination. Having thus finished a cell, her
next business is to fill it to within half a line of the orifice,
with a rose-coloured conserve composed of honey
and pollen, usually collected from the flowers of thistles;
and then having deposited her egg, she closes the orifice
with three pieces of leaf so exactly circular, that a pair
of compasses could not define their margin with more
truth; and coinciding so precisely with the walls of the
cell, as to be retained in their situation merely by the
nicety of their adaptation. After this covering is fitted in,
there remains still a concavity which receives the convex
end of the succeeding cell; and in this manner the indefatigable
little animal proceeds until she has completed
the six or seven cells which compose her cylinder.</p>

<p>The process which one of these bees employs in cutting
the pieces of leaf that compose her nest is worthy of
attention. Nothing can be more expeditious: she is not
longer about it than we should be with a pair of scissors.
After hovering for some moments over a rose-bush, as
if to reconnoitre the ground, the bee alights upon the
leaf which she has selected, usually taking her station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
upon its edge so that the margin passes between her legs.
With her strong mandibles she cuts without intermission
in a curve line so as to detach a triangular portion.
When this hangs by the last fibre, lest its weight should
carry her to the ground, she balances her little wings for
flight, and the very moment it parts from the leaf flies
off with it in triumph; the detached portion remaining
bent between her legs in a direction perpendicular to
her body. Thus without rule or compasses do these
diminutive creatures mete out the materials of their work
into portions of an ellipse, into ovals or circles, accurately
accommodating the dimensions of the several pieces
of each figure to each other. What other architect could
carry impressed upon the tablet of his memory the entire
idea of the edifice which he has to erect, and, destitute
of square or plumb-line, cut out his materials in
their exact dimensions without making a single mistake?
Yet this is what our little bee invariably does. So far
are human art and reason excelled by the teaching of
the Almighty<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>.</p>

<p>Other insects besides bees construct habitations of different
kinds for their young, as various species of burrowing
wasps (<i>Fossores</i>), <i>Geotrupes</i>, &amp;c., which deposit
their eggs in cylindrical excavations that become the
abode of the future larv√¶. In the procedures of most
of these, nothing worth particularizing occurs; but one
species called by Reaumur the mason-wasp, (<i>Odynerus
muraria</i>,) referred to in a former letter, works upon so
singular a plan, that it would be improper to pass it over
in silence, especially as these nests may be found in this
country in most sandy banks exposed to the sun. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
insect bores a cylindrical cavity from two to three inches
deep, in hard sand which its mandibles alone would be
scarcely capable of penetrating, were it not provided with
a slightly glutinous liquor which it pours out of its mouth,
that, like the vinegar with which Hannibal softened the
Alps, acts upon the cement of the sand, and renders the
separation of the grains easy to the double pickaxe with
which our little pioneer is furnished. But the most remarkable
circumstance is the mode in which it disposes
of the excavated materials. Instead of throwing them
at random on a heap, it carefully forms them into little
oblong pellets, and arranges them round the entrance of
the hole so as to form a tunnel, which, when the excavation
is completed, is often not less than two or three
inches in length. For the greater part of its height this
tunnel is upright, but towards the top it bends into a
curve, always however retaining its cylindrical form.
The little masses are so attached to each other in this
cylinder, as to leave numerous vacuities between them,
which give it the appearance of filagree-work. You will
readily divine that the excavated hole is intended for the
reception of an egg, but for what purpose the external
tunnel is meant is not so apparent. One use, and perhaps
the most important, would seem to be to prevent the incursions
of the artful Ichneumons, <i>Chrysid√¶</i>, &amp;c. which
are ever on the watch to insinuate their parasitic young
into the nests of other insects: it may render their access
to the nest more difficult; they may dread to enter into
so long and dark a defile. I have seen, however, more
than once a <i>Chrysis</i> come out of these tunnels. That its
use is only temporary, is plain from the circumstance
that the insect employs the whole fabric, when its egg is
laid and store of food procured, in filling up the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
vacuity of the hole; taking down the pellets, which
are very conveniently at hand, and placing them in it
until the entrance is filled<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>.&mdash;Latreille informs us, that
a nearly similar tunnel, but composed of grains of earth,
is built at the entrance of its cell by a bee of his family
of <i>pioneers</i><a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>.</p>

<p>Under this head, too, may be most conveniently arranged
the very singular habitations of the larv√¶ of the
Linn√¶an genus <i>Cynips</i>, the gall-fly, though they can
with no propriety be said to be <i>constructed</i> by the mother,
who, provided with an instrument as potent as an
enchanter's wand, has but to pierce the site of the foundation,
and commodious apartments, as if by magic,
spring up and surround the germe of her future descendants.
I allude to those vegetable excrescencies
termed <i>galls</i>, some of which resembling beautiful berries
and others apples, you must have frequently observed
on the leaves of the oak, and of which one species, the
Aleppo gall, as I have before noticed, is of such importance
in the ingenious art "<i>de peindre la parole et de
parler aux yeux</i><a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>." All these tumours owe their origin to
the deposition of an egg in the substance out of which
they grow. This egg, too small almost for perception,
the parent insect, a little four-winged fly, introduces into
a puncture made by her curious spiral sting, and in a
few hours it becomes surrounded with a fleshy chamber,
which not only serves its young for shelter and defence,
but also for food; the future little hermit feeding upon
its interior and there undergoing its metamorphosis.
Nothing can be more varied than these habitations.
Some are of a globular form, a bright red colour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
smooth fleshy consistence, resembling beautiful fruits,
for which indeed, as you have before been told, they are
eaten in the Levant: others, beset with spines or clothed
with hair, are so much like seed-vessels, that an eminent
modern chemist has contended respecting the Aleppo
gall, that it is actually a capsule<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>. Some are exactly
round; others like little mushrooms; others resemble
artichokes; while others again might be taken for flowers:
in short, they are of a hundred different forms, and
of all sizes from that of a pin's head to that of a walnut.
Nor is their situation on the plant less diversified. Some
are found upon the leaf itself; others upon the footstalks
only; others upon the roots; and others upon the buds<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>.
Some of them cause the branches upon which they grow
to shoot out into such singular forms, that the plants producing
them were esteemed by the old botanists distinct
species. Of this kind is the <i>Rose-willow</i>, which old Gerard
figures and describes as "not only making a gallant
shew, but also yeelding a most cooling aire in the heat
of summer, being set up in houses for the decking of the
same." This willow is nothing more than one of the
common species, whose twigs, in consequence of the deposition
of the egg of a Cynips in their summits, there
shoot out into numerous leaves totally different in shape
from the other leaves of the tree, and arranged not much
unlike those composing the flower of a rose, adhering to
the stem even after the others fall off. Sir James Smith
mentions a similar <i>lusus</i> on the Provence willows, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
at first he took for a tufted lichen<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>. From the same
cause the twigs of the common wild rose often shoot out
into a beautiful tuft of numerous reddish moss-like fibres
wholly dissimilar from the leaves of the plant, deemed
by the old naturalists a very valuable medical substance,
to which they erroneously gave the name of Bedeguar.
None of these variations is accidental or common to several
of the tribe, but each peculiar to the galls formed
by a single and distinct species of <i>Cynips</i>.</p>

<p>How the mere insertion of an egg into the substance
of a leaf or twig, even if accompanied, as some imagine,
by a peculiar fluid, should cause the growth of such singular
protuberances around it, philosophers are as little
able to explain, as why the insertion of a particle of variolous
matter into a child's arm should cover it with
pustules of small pox. In both cases the effects seem to
proceed from some action of the foreign substance upon
the secreting vessels of the animal or vegetable: but of
the nature of this action we know nothing. Thus much
is ascertained by the observations of Reaumur and Malpighi&mdash;that
the production of the gall, which however
large attains its full size in a day or two<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>, is caused by
the egg or some accompanying fluid: not by the larva,
which does not appear until the gall is fully formed<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>;
that the galls which spring from leaves almost constantly
take their origin from nerves<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>; and that the egg, at the
same time that it causes the growth of the gall, itself derives
nourishment from the substance that surrounds it,
becoming considerably larger before it is hatched than
it was when first deposited<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>.&mdash;When chemically analysed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
galls are found to contain only the same principles
as the plant from which they spring, but in a more
concentrated state.</p>

<p>No productions of nature seem to have puzzled the
ancient philosophers more than galls. The commentator
on Dioscorides, Mathiolus, who agreeably to the doctrine
of those days ascribed their origin to spontaneous
generation, gravely informs us that weighty prognostications
as to the events of the ensuing year may be deduced
from ascertaining whether they contain spiders,
worms, or flies. Other philosophers, who knew that
except by rare accident no other animals are to be found
in galls, besides grubs of different kinds which they rationally
conceived to spring from eggs, were chiefly at a
loss to account for the conveyance of these eggs into the
middle of a substance in which they could find no external
orifice. They therefore inferred that they were
the eggs of insects deposited in the earth, which had
been drawn up by the roots of trees along with the sap,
and after passing through different vessels had stopped,
some in the leaves, others in the twigs, and had there
hatched and produced galls! Redi's solution of the difficulty
was even more extraordinary. This philosopher,
who had so triumphantly combated the absurdities of
spontaneous generation, fell himself into greater. Not
having been able to witness the deposition of eggs by
the parent flies in the plants that produce galls, he took
it for granted that the grubs which he found within
them could not spring from eggs: and he was equally
unwilling to admit their origin from spontaneous generation,&mdash;an
admission which would have been fatal to his
own most brilliant discoveries. He therefore cut the knot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
by supposing that to the same <i>vegetative soul</i> by which
fruits and plants are produced, is committed the charge
of creating the larv√¶ found in galls<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>! An instance truly
humiliating, how little we can infer from a man's just
ideas on one point, that he will not be guilty of the most
pitiable absurdity on another!</p>

<p>Though by far the greater part of the vegetable excrescencies
termed galls, are caused by insects of the
genus <i>Cynips</i>, they do not always originate from this
tribe. Some are produced by weevils belonging to
Sch√ºppel's genus <i>Ceutorhynchus</i>; as those on the roots
of kedlock (<i>Sinapis arvensis</i>), which I have ascertained
to be inhabited by the larv√¶ of <i>Curculio contractus</i> Marsh.,
<i>Rhynch√¶nus assimilis</i>, F. From the knob-like galls on
turnips called in some places the <i>anbury</i>, I have bred
another of these weevils, (<i>Curculio pleurostigma</i>, Marsh.,
<i>Rhynch√¶nus sulcicollis</i>, Gyll.) and I have little doubt that
the same insects, or species allied to them, cause the
clubbing of the roots of cabbages. It seems to be a beetle
of the same family that is figured by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>, as
causing the galls on the leaves of the lime-tree. Others
owe their origin to moths, as those resembling a nutmeg
which Reaumur received from Cyprus<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>; and others
again to two-winged flies, as the woody galls of the thistle
caused by <i>Trypeta Cardui</i><a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>, and the cottony galls
found on ground ivy, wild thyme, &amp;c. as well as a very
singular one on the juniper resembling a flower, described
by De Geer<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a>, all which are the work of minute
gall-gnats (<i>Cecidomyi√¶</i>, Latr.). Some of these last convert
even the flowers of plants into a kind of galls, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
<i>T. Loti</i> of De Geer<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>, which inhabits the blossoms of
<i>Lotus corniculatus</i>; and one which I have myself observed
to render the flowers of <i>Erysimum Barbarea</i> like
a hop blossom. A similar monstrous appearance is communicated
to the flowers of <i>Teucrium supinum</i> by a little
field-bug, <i>Tingis Teucrii</i> of Host<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a>, and to another plant
of the same genus by one of the same tribe described
by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>. In these two last instances, however,
the habitations do not seem strictly entitled to the appellation
of galls, as they originate not from the egg,
but from the larva, which, in the operation of extracting
the sap, in some way imparts a morbid action to the
juices, causing the flower to expand unnaturally: and
the same remark is applicable to the gall-like swellings
formed by many Aphides, as <i>A. Pistaci√¶</i>, which causes
the leaves of different species of <i>Pistacia</i> to expand into
red finger-like cavities; <i>A. Abietis</i>, which converts the
buds or young shoots of the fir into a very beautiful
gall, somewhat resembling a fir-cone, or a pine-apple in
miniature; and <i>A. Bursari√¶</i>, which with its brood inhabits
angular utriculi on the leafstalk of the black poplar,
numbers of which I have observed on those trees by
the road-side from Hull to Cottingham.&mdash;The majority
of galls are what entomologists have denominated monothalamous,
or consisting of only one chamber or cell;
but some are polythalamous, or consisting of several.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having thus described the most remarkable of the
habitations constructed by the parent insects for the accommodation
of their future young, I proceed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
second kind mentioned, namely, those which are formed
by the insect itself for its own use. These may be again
subdivided into such as are the work of the insects in
their larva state; and such as are formed by perfect
insects.</p>

<p>Many larv√¶ of all orders need no other habitations
than the holes which they form in seeking for, or eating,
the substances upon which they feed. Of this description
are the majority of subterranean larv√¶, and
those which feed on wood, as the <i>Bostrichi</i> or labyrinth
beetles; the <i>Anobia</i> which excavate the little circular
holes frequently met with in ancient furniture and the
wood work of old houses; and many larv√¶ of other
orders, particularly <i>Lepidoptera</i>. One of these last, the
larva of <i>Cossus ligniperda</i> differs from its congeners in
fabricating for its residence during winter a habitation
of pieces of wood lined with fine silk<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>. Under this
division, too, come the singular habitations of the subcutaneous
larv√¶, so called from the circumstance of
their feeding upon the parenchyma included between
the upper and under cuticles of the leaves of plants, between
which, though the whole leaf is often not thicker
than a sheet of writing-paper, they find at once food
and lodging. You must have been at some time struck by
certain white zigzag or labyrinth-like lines on the leaves
of the dandelion, bramble, and numerous other plants:
the next-time you meet with one of them, if you hold it
up to the light you will perceive that the colour of these
lines is owing to the pulpy substance of the leaf having
there been removed; and at the further end you will
probably remark a dark-coloured speck, which, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
carefully extricated from its covering, you will find to
be the little miner of the tortuous galleries which you
are admiring. Some of these minute larv√¶, to which
the parenchyma of a leaf is a vast country, requiring several
weeks to be traversed by the slow process of mining
which they adopt&mdash;that of eating the excavated materials
as they proceed&mdash;are transformed into beetles (<i>Cionus
Thapsi</i>, &amp;c.); others into flies; and a still greater number
into very minute moths, as <i>Gracillaria? Wilkella</i>,
<i>Clerkella</i>, &amp;c. Many of these last are little miracles of
nature, which has lavished on them the most splendid tints
tastefully combined with gold, silver and pearl: so that,
were they but formed upon a larger scale, they would
far eclipse all other animals in richness of decoration.</p>

<p>Another tribe of larv√¶, not very numerous, content
themselves for their habitations with simple holes, into
which they retire occasionally. Many of these are merely
cylindrical burrows in the ground, as those formed by
the larv√¶ of field-crickets, Cicindel√¶ and Ephemer√¶.
But the larv√¶ of the very remarkable lepidopterous genus
(<i>Nycterobius</i> of Mr. MacLeay) before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>,
excavate for themselves dwellings of a more artificial
construction; forming cylindrical holes in the trees of
New Holland, particularly the different species of <i>Banksia</i>,
to which they are very destructive, and defending
the entrance against the attacks of the Mantes and other
carnivorous insects by a sort of trap-door composed of
silk interwoven with leaves and pieces of excrement, securely
fastened at the upper end, but left loose at the
lower for the free passage of the occupant. This abode
they regularly quit at sun-set, for the purpose of laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
in a store of the leaves on which they feed. These they
drag by one at a time into their cell until the approach
of light, when they retreat precipitately into it, and there
remain closely secluded the whole day, enjoying the
booty which their nocturnal range has provided. One
species lifts up the loose end of its door by its tail, and
enters backward, dragging after it a leaf of <i>Banksia serrata</i>,
which it holds by the footstalk<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>.</p>

<p>A third description of larv√¶, chiefly of the two lepidopterous
tribes <i>Tortricid√¶</i> and <i>Tineid√¶</i>, form into convenient
habitations the leaves of the plants on which they
feed. Some of these merely connect together with a few
silken threads several leaves so as to form an irregular
packet, in the centre of which the little hermit lives.
Others confine themselves to a single leaf, of which they
simply fold one part over the other. A third description
form and inhabit a sort of roll, by some species made
cylindrical, by others conical, resembling the papers
into which grocers put their sugar, and as accurately
constructed, only there is an opening left at the smaller
extremity for the egress of the insect in case of need. If
you were to see one of these rolls, you would immediately
ask by what mechanism it could possibly be made&mdash;how
an insect without fingers could contrive to bend a leaf
into a roll, and to keep it in that form until fastened with
the silk which holds it together? The following is the
operation. The little caterpillar first fixes a series of
silken cables from one side of the leaf to the other. She
next pulls at these cables with her feet; and when she
has forced the sides to approach, she <i>fastens</i> them together
with shorter threads of silk. If the insect finds that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
one of the larger nerves of the leaf is so strong as to resist
her efforts, she weakens it by gnawing it here and
there half through. What engineer could act more sagaciously?&mdash;To
form one of the conical or horn-shaped
rolls, which are not composed of a whole leaf, but of a
long triangular portion cut out of the edge, some other
man&#339;uvres are requisite. Placing herself upon the leaf,
the caterpillar cuts out with her jaws the piece which is
to compose her roll. She does not however entirely detach
it: it would then want a base. She detaches that
part only which is to form the contour of the horn. This
portion is a triangular strap, which she rolls as she cuts.
When the body of the horn is finished, as it is intended
to be fixed upon the leaf in nearly an upright position,
it is necessary to elevate it. To effect this, she proceeds
as we should with an inclined obelisk. She attaches
threads or little cables towards the point of the pyramid,
and raises it by the weight of her body<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>.</p>

<p>A still greater degree of dexterity is manifested in
fabricating the habitations of the larv√¶ of some other
moths which feed on the leaves of the rose-tree, apple,
elm, and oak, on the under-side of which they may in
summer be often found. These form an oblong cavity
in the interior of a leaf by eating the parenchyma between
the two membranes composing its upper and under
side, which, after having detached them from the surrounding
portion, it joins with silk so artfully that the
seams are scarcely discoverable even with a lens, so as to
compose a case or horn, cylindrical in the middle, its
anterior orifice circular, its posterior triangular. Were
this dwelling cylindrical in every part, the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
two pieces that compose it would be very simple; but
the different shape of the two ends renders it necessary
that each side should have peculiar and dissimilar curvatures;
and Reaumur assures us, that these are as
complex and difficult to imitate as the contours of the
pieces of cloth that compose the back of a coat. Some
of this tribe, whose proceedings I had the pleasure of
witnessing a short time since upon the alders in the Hull
Botanic Garden, more ingenious than their brethren,
and willing to save the labour of sewing up two seams in
their dwelling, insinuate themselves near the edge of a
leaf instead of in its middle. Here they form their excavation,
mining into the very crenatures between the
two surfaces of the leaf, which, being joined together at
the edge, there form one seam of the case, and from their
dentated figure give it a very singular appearance, not
unlike that of some fishes which have fins upon their
backs. The opposite side they are necessarily forced to
cut and sew up, but even in this operation they show an
ingenuity and contrivance worthy of admiration. The
moths, which cut out their suit from the middle of the
leaf, wholly detach the two surfaces that compose it before
they proceed to join them together, the serrated incisions
made by their teeth, which, if they do not cut as
fast, in this respect are more effective than any scissors,
interlacing each other so as to support the separated
portions until they are properly joined. But it is obvious
that this process cannot be followed by those
moths which cut out their house from the edge of a leaf.
If these were to detach the inner side before they had
joined the two pieces together, the builder as well as his
dwelling would inevitably fall. They therefore, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
making any incision, prudently <i>run</i> (as a sempstress
would call it) loosely together in distant points the two
membranes on that side. Then putting out their heads
they cut the intermediate portions, carefully avoiding the
larger nerves of the leaf; afterwards they sew up the detached
sides more closely, and only intersect the nerves
when their labour is completed<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>.&mdash;The habitation made
by a moth, which lives upon a species of <i>Astragalus</i>, is
in like manner formed of the epidermis of the leaves, but
in this several corrugated pieces project over each other,
so as to resemble the furbelows once in fashion<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>.</p>

<p>Other larv√¶ construct their habitations wholly of silk.
Of this description is that of a moth, whose abode, except
as to the materials which compose it, is formed on
the same general plan as that just described, and the
larva in like manner feeds only on the parenchyma of
the leaf. In the beginning of spring, if you examine
the leaves of your pear-trees, you will scarcely fail to
meet with some beset on the under surface with several
perpendicular downy russet-coloured projections, about
a quarter of an inch high, and not much thicker than a
pin, of a cylindrical shape, with a protuberance at the
base, and altogether resembling at first sight so many
spines growing out of the leaf. You would never suspect
that these could be the habitations of insects; yet
that they are is certain. Detach one of them, and give
it a gentle squeeze, and you will see emerge from the
lower end a minute caterpillar with a yellowish body
and black head. Examine the place from which you
have removed it, and you will perceive a round excavation
in the cuticle and parenchyma of the leaf, the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
of the end of the tube by which it was concealed. This
excavation is the work of the above-mentioned caterpillar,
which obtains its food by moving its little tent
from one part of the leaf to the other, and eating away
the space immediately under it. It touches no other
part; and when these insects abound, as they often do
to the great injury of pear-trees<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>, you will perceive every
leaf bristled with them, and covered with little withered
specks, the vestiges of their former meals. The case in
which the caterpillar resides, and which is quite essential
to its existence, is composed of silk spun from its mouth
almost as soon as it is excluded from the egg. As it increases
in size, it enlarges its habitation by slitting it in
two, and introducing a strip of new materials. But the
most curious circumstance in the history of this little
Arab is the mode by which it retains its tent in a perpendicular
posture. This it effects partly by attaching
silken threads from the protuberance at the base to the
surrounding surface of the leaf. But being not merely
a mechanician, but a profound natural philosopher well
acquainted with the properties of air, it has another resource
when any extraordinary violence threatens to
overturn its slender turret. It forms a <i>vacuum</i> in the
protuberance at the base, and thus as effectually fastens
it to the leaf as if an air-pump had been employed!
This vacuum is caused by the insect's retreating on the
least alarm up its narrow case, which its body completely
fills, and thus leaving the space below free of air. In
detaching one of these cases you may easily convince
yourself of the fact. If you seize it suddenly while the
insect is at the bottom, you will find that it is readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
pulled off, the silken cords giving way to a very slight
force; but if, proceeding gently, you give the insect time
to retreat, the case will be held so closely to the leaf as
to require a much stronger effort to loosen it. As if
aware that, should the air get admission from below, and
thus render a vacuum impracticable, the strongest bulwark
of its fortress would be destroyed, our little philosopher
carefully avoids gnawing a hole in the leaf, contenting
itself with the pasturage afforded by the parenchyma
above the lower epidermis; and when the produce
of this area is consumed, it gnaws asunder the cords
of its tent, and pitches it at a short distance as before.
Having attained its full growth, it assumes the pupa
state, and after a while issues out of its confinement a
small brown moth, with long hind legs, the <i>Phal√¶na
Tinea serratella</i> of Linn√©<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>.</p>

<p>Some larv√¶, which form their covering of pure silk,
are not content with a single coating, but actually envelop
themselves in another, open on one side and very
much resembling a cloak; whence Reaumur called them
"<i>Teignes √† fourreau √† manteau</i>." What is very striking
in the construction of this cloak, is, that the silk, instead
of being woven into one uniform close texture, is formed
into numerous transparent scales over-wrapping each
other, and altogether very much resembling the scales
of a fish<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>. These mantle-covered cases, one of which
I once had the pleasure of discovering, are inhabited
by the larva of a little moth apparently first described
by Dr. Zincken genannt Sommer, who calls it <i>Tinea
palliatella</i><a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>Various substances besides silk are fabricated into habitations
by other larv√¶, though usually joined together
either with silk or an analogous gummy material. Thus
<i>Diurnea? Lichenum</i> forms of pieces of lichen a dwelling
resembling one of the turreted <i>Helices</i>, many of which I
observed in June 1812 on an oak in Barham. The larv√¶
of another moth, which also feeds upon lichens, instead
of employing these vegetables in forming its habitation,
composes it of grains of stone eroded from the
walls of buildings upon which its food is found, and connected
by a silken cement. These insects were the subject
of a paper in the Memoirs of the French Academy<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>,
by M. de la Voye, who, from the circumstance of their
being found in great abundance on mouldering walls, attributed
to them the power of eating stone, and regarded
them as the authors of injuries proceeding solely from
the hand of time: for the insects themselves are so minute,
and the coating of grains of stone composing their
cases is so trifling, that Reaumur observes they could
scarcely make any perceptible impression on a wall from
which they had procured materials for ages<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a>.&mdash;Another
lepidopterous larva, but of a much larger size and different
genus, the case of which is preserved in the cabinet
of the President of the Linnean Society, who pointed it
out to me, employs the spines apparently of some species
of <i>Mimosa</i>, which are ranged side by side so as to
form a very elegant fluted cylinder. A similar arrangement
of pieces of small twigs is observable in the habitation
of the females<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> of the larv√¶ of a moth referred by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Von Scheven to <i>Bombyx vestita</i>, F.; which Ochsenheimer
regards as synonymous with <i>Psyche graminella</i>, while <i>P.
Viciella</i> of the <i>Wiener Verzeichniss</i> covers itself with short
portions of the stems of grasses placed transversely, and
united by means of silk into a five- or six-sided case.
The habitation of a third larva of the same family, described
and figured by Reaumur (<i>P. graminella</i>, Ochsenh.
just named), is composed of squarish pieces of the
<i>leaves</i> of grass fastened only at one end, and overwrapping
each other like the tiles of a house; and that of
another noticed by the same author, of portions of the
smallest twigs of broom arranged on the same plan<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>.
Indeed the larv√¶ of the whole of this tribe of moths,
now separated into a distinct genus (<i>Psyche</i>, Schrank,
Ochsenh., <i>Fumea</i>, Haworth), but which according to
Germar needs further subdivision, reside in cases or
sacks (whence they are called by the Germans <i>Sacktr√§ger</i>)
composed of silk, and fragments of grass, bark, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The larv√¶ of a small beetle (<i>Clytra longimana</i>) reside
in oviform cases apparently of a calcareous or earthy
substance, joined by a gummy cement and covered with
red hairs, the origin of which, H√ºbner, who first discovered
them, could not account for: and from the observations
of Amstein and the French translator of
Fuessly's <i>Archives</i>, it seems probable that the larv√¶ of all
the species of <i>Clytra</i>, and according to Zschorn, at least
of one species of Cryptocephalus, (<i>C. duodecimpunctatus</i>)
differing in this respect from all other known <i>Coleoptera</i>,
live in moveable cases<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>. I have however found a species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
of <i>Limnius</i> (<i>L. √¶neus</i>) inhabiting a fixed case made
of particles of stone or sand.</p>

<p>Wax is the principal substance employed in the habitations
of the larv√¶ before mentioned<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>, occasionally so
destructive to bee-hives. These insidious depredators,
which are mentioned by Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>, tying together, with
silk, grains of wax (which, and not honey, forms their
food), construct galleries of a considerable length, and
thus concealed from the sight, and protected from the
stings of the armed people whom they have attacked,
push their mines into the very heart of the fortress, and
pursue their robberies in perfect safety<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>.</p>

<p>As many of the habitations which I have been describing,
fit the body of the insects as close as a coat, they
might perhaps with more propriety be called <i>clothes</i>.
This is certainly the most appropriate designation of the
abodes of some species of Tine√¶ (the clothes' moths),
which not only cover themselves with a coat, but employ
the very same material in its composition as we do in
ours, forming it of wool or hair curiously felted together.
Like us, they are born naked, but not like us helpless
at that period, scarcely have they breathed before they
begin to clothe themselves; thus contradicting Dr. Paley's
assertion, that "the <i>human</i> animal is the only one
which is naked, and the only one which can clothe
itself<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>:" and wisely inattentive to change of fashion, the
same suit serves them from their birth to mature age.
The shape of their dress is adapted to that of their body&mdash;a
cylindrical case open at both ends. The stuff of
which it is composed is the manufacture of the larva of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
the moth (<i>Tinea</i>), which incorporates wool or hair artfully
cut from our clothes or furniture, with silk drawn
from its own mouth, into a warm and thick tissue: and
as this would not be soft enough for its tender skin, it
also lines the inside of its coat with a layer of pure silk.
Since this suit of clothes during the earliest age of the
insect accurately fits its body, you will readily conceive
that it will frequently require enlarging. This the little
occupant accomplishes as dexterously as any tailor. If
the case merely requires lengthening, the task is easy.
All that is needful is to add a new ring of hair or wool
and silk to each end. But to enlarge it in width is not
so simple an affair. Yet it sets to work precisely as we
should, slitting the case on the two opposite sides, and
then adroitly inserting between them two pieces of the
requisite size. It does not, however, cut open the case
from one end to the other at once: the sides would separate
too far asunder, and the insect be left naked. It
therefore first cuts each side about half way down, and
then after having filled up the fissure proceeds to cut
the remaining half: so that, in fact, four enlargements
are made, and four separate pieces inserted.&mdash;The colour
of the habit is always the same as that of the stuff
from which it is taken. Thus, if its original colour be
blue, and the insect previously to enlarging it be put
upon red cloth, the circles at the end and two stripes
down the middle will be red. If placed alternately upon
cloths of different hues, its dress will be parti-coloured
like that of a Harlequin.&mdash;The injury occasioned to us
by these insects is not confined to the quantity of materials
consumed in clothing and feeding themselves. In
moving from place to place they seem to be as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
incommoded by the long hairs which surround them, as we
are by walking amongst high grass; and accordingly,
marching scythe in hand, with their teeth they cut out a
smooth road, from time to time reposing themselves, and
anchoring their little case with small silken cables.</p>

<p>If, as I hope, you are induced to investigate the manners
of these insects, you have but to leave an old coat
for a few months undisturbed in a dark closet, and you
may be pretty certain of meeting with an abundant
colony.</p>

<p>Not merely wool or hair, but another substance analogous
to one employed in our dress, is adopted for their
clothing by other insects. The larva of a fly which lives
on the seeds of willows, makes itself a very beautiful case
of their cottony down, not only impervious to wet and
cold, but serving, if accidentally blown into the water,
which from the situation of these trees frequently happens,
as a buoyant little barge which is wafted safely to
the shore<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>.</p>

<p>The habitations which we have hitherto been considering,
are formed by larv√¶ that live on land, but
others equally remarkable are constructed by aquatic
species, the larv√¶ of the various <i>Phrygane√¶</i> L., a tribe
of four-winged insects which an ordinary observer would
call moths, but which are even of a distinct order (<i>Trichoptera</i>),
not having their wings covered by the scales
which adorn the lepidopterous race. If you are desirous
of examining the insects to which I am alluding, you
have only to place yourself by the side of a clear and
shallow pool of water, and you cannot fail to observe at
the bottom little oblong moving masses resembling pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
of straw, wood, or even stone. These are the larv√¶ in
question, well known to fishermen by the title of <i>Caddis-worms</i>,
and which, if you take them out of the water, you
will observe to inhabit cases of a very singular conformation.
Of the larva itself, which somewhat resembles
the caterpillars of many <i>Lepidoptera</i>, nothing is to be
seen but the head and six legs by means of which it
moves itself in the water, and drags after it the case in
which the rest of the body is inclosed, and into which
on any alarm it wholly retires. The construction of these
habitations is very various. Some select four or five
pieces of the leaves of grass, which they glue together
into a shapely polygonal case; others employ portions of
the stems of rushes, placed side by side so as to form an
elegant fluted cylinder; some arrange round them pieces
of leaves like a spirally-rolled ribband<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>; others inclose
themselves in a mass of the leaves of any aquatic plants
united without regularity; and others again form their
abode of minute pieces of wood either fresh or decayed<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>.
One, like the <i>Sabell√¶</i><a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>, forms a horn-shaped case composed
of grains of sand, so equal in size, and so nicely and
regularly gummed together, the sides throughout being
of the thickness of one grain only, that the first time I
viewed it I could scarcely persuade myself it could be the
work of an insect. The case of <i>Leptocerus bimaculatus</i>,
which is less artificially constructed of a mixture of mud
and sand, is pyriform, and has its end curiously stopped
by a plate formed of grains of sand, with a central aperture<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>.
Other species construct houses which may be
called alive, forming them of the shells of various aquatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
snails of different kinds and sizes even while inhabited,
all of which are immoveably fixed to it, and dragged
about at its pleasure&mdash;a covering as singular as if a savage,
instead of clothing himself with squirrels' skins,
should sew together into a coat the animals themselves.
However various may be the form of the case externally,
within it is usually cylindrical and lined with silk; and
though seldom apparently wider than just to admit the
body of the insect, some species have the power of turning
round in it, and of putting out their head at either
end<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>. Some larv√¶ constantly make their cases of the
same materials; others employ indifferently any that are
at hand; and the new ones which they construct as they
increase in size (for they have not the faculty, like the
larva of the moth, of enlarging them) have often an appearance
quite dissimilar to that of the old. Even those
that are most careless about the nature of the materials
of their house, are solicitously attentive to one circumstance
respecting them, namely, their specific gravity.
Not having the power of swimming, but only of walking
at the bottom of the water by aid of the six legs attached
to the fore part of the body which is usually protruded
out of the case, and the insect itself being heavier than
water, it is of great importance that its house should be
of a specific gravity so nearly that of the element in
which it resides, as while walking neither to incommode
it by its weight, nor by too great buoyancy; and it is as
essential that it should be so equally <i>ballasted</i> in every
part as to be readily moveable in any position. Under
these circumstances our Caddis-worms evince their proficiency
in hydrostatics, selecting the most suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
substances; and, if the cell be too heavy, glueing to it a bit
of leaf or straw; or, if too light, a shell or piece of
gravel. It is from this necessity of regulating the specific
gravity, that to the cases formed with the greatest
regularity we often see attached a seemingly superfluous
piece of wood, leaf, or the like.</p>

<p>A larva of one of the aquatic <i>Tipulari√¶</i> lives in cases
somewhat similar to those of some <i>Phrygane√¶</i>. Several
of these of a fusiform shape and brown colour, composed
partly of silk and partly perhaps of fragments of leaves,
and inhabited by a red larva apparently of a <i>Chironomus</i>,
were found by Reaumur upon dead leaves in a pool of
water in the Bois de Boulogne<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.</p>

<p>In concluding this head I may observe, that here might
have been described the various abodes which solitary
larv√¶ prepare for themselves previously to assuming the
pupa, and intended for their protection in that defenceless
stage of existence; but as I shall have occasion again
to refer to them in speaking of the larva state of insects,
I shall defer their description to that letter, to which they
more strictly belong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the next division of the habitations of insects&mdash;those
formed by solitary <i>perfect</i> insects for their own accommodation&mdash;I
shall select for description only two,
both the work of spiders, and alluded to in a former letter,
which indeed, with the exception of the inartificial
retreats made by the <i>Grylli</i>, <i>Cicindel√¶</i>, and perhaps a
few others, are the only ones properly belonging to it.</p>

<p>The habitation of one of these (<i>Cteniza c√¶mentaria</i>)
is subterraneous, not a mere shallow cavity, but a tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
or gallery upwards of two feet in length and half an inch
broad. This tunnel, so vast compared with the size of
the insect, it digs by means of its strong jaws in a steep
bank of bare clay, so that the rain may readily run off
without penetrating to its dwelling. Its next operation
is to line the whole from top to bottom with a web of fine
silk, which serves the double purpose of preventing the
earth that composes the walls from falling in, and, by its
connexion with the door of the orifice, of giving information
to the spider of what is passing above. You doubtless
suppose that in saying <i>door</i> I am speaking metaphorically.
It could never enter into your conception that
any animal, much less an insect, could construct any
thing really deserving of that name&mdash;any thing like our
doors, turning upon a hinge, and accurately fitted to the
frame of the opening which it is intended to close. Yet
such a door, incredible as it may seem, is actually framed
by this spider. It does not indeed, like us, compose it
of wood, but of several coats of dried earth fastened to
each other with silk. When finished, its outline is as
perfectly circular as if traced with compasses; the inferior
surface is convex and smooth, the superior flat and
rough, and so like the adjoining earth as not to be distinguishable
from it. This door the ingenious artist fixes
to the entrance of her gallery by a hinge of silk, which
plays with the greatest freedom, and allows it to be
opened and shut with ease; and as if acquainted with the
laws of gravity, she invariably fixes the hinge at the
<i>highest</i> side of the opening, so that the door when pushed
up shuts again by its own weight. She has not less sagaciously
left a little edge or groove just within the entrance,
upon which the door closes, and to which it fits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
with such precision, that it seems to make but one surface
with it. Such is the astonishing structure of this little animal's
abode; nor is its defence of its subterraneous cavern
less surprising. If an observer adroitly insinuates the
point of a pin under the edge of the door, and elevates
it a little, he immediately perceives a very strong resistance.&mdash;What
is its cause?&mdash;The spider, warned by the
vibrations of the threads which extend from the door to
the bottom of her gallery, runs with all speed to the
door, fastens its legs to it on one side, and on the other
to the walls, and, turning upon its back, pulls with all its
might. Thus the door is alternately shut or opened, as
the exertions of the observer or of the spider prevail.
It is easy to guess which will in the end conquer; and
the spider, when it finds all resistance ineffectual, betakes
itself to flight, and retreats. If, to make a further experiment,
the observer fastens down the door so that it cannot
be forced open, the next morning he will find a new
entrance, with a new door formed at a small distance;
or, if he take the door entirely away, another will be
constructed in less than twelve hours.</p>

<p>The habitation thus singularly formed and defended
is not at all used as a snare, but merely as a safe abode
for the spider, which hunts its prey at night only; and,
when caught, devours it in security at the bottom of its
den, which is generally strewed with the remains of coleopterous
insects<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>.&mdash;From some curious observations
of M. Dorthes on this species in the second volume of
the <i>Linnean Transactions</i>, it appears that both the male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
and female spider and as many as thirty young ones occasionally
inhabit one of these galleries.&mdash;<i>Mygale Sauvagesii</i>
of Rossi, which is a distinct species found in Corsica,
forms a similar habitation<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>.</p>

<p>The galleries just described are the work of an European
species not uncommon in the south of France;
but similar ones are fabricated by <i>Thomisus venatorius</i>,
an inhabitant of the West India islands, as well as by
many other tropical species. I have seen one of these,
which had been dug out of the earth, in the cabinet of
Thomas Hall, Esq. F.L.S., that was nearly a foot in
length, and above an inch in diameter, forming a cylindrical
bag of dark-coloured silk, closed at the bottom,
and accurately fitted at the top by a door or lid.</p>

<p>The habitation of <i>Argyroneta aquatica</i>, the other spider
to which I alluded, is chiefly remarkable for the element
in which it is constructed and the materials that compose
it. It is built in the midst of water, and formed, in fact,
of air! Spiders are usually terrestrial, but this is aquatic,
or rather amphibious; for though she resides in the
midst of water, in which she swims with great celerity,
sometimes on her belly but more frequently on her back,
and is an admirable diver, she not unfrequently hunts on
shore, and, having caught her prey, plunges with it to the
bottom of the water. Here it is she forms her singular
and unique abode. She would evidently have but a very
uncomfortable time were she constantly wet, but this she
is sagacious enough to avoid; and by availing herself of
some well-known philosophical principles, she constructs
for herself an apartment in which, like the mermaids and
sea-nymphs of fable, she resides in comfort and security.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
The following is her process. First she spins loose
threads in various directions attached to the leaves of
aquatic plants, which may be called the frame-work of
her chamber, and over them she spreads a transparent
varnish resembling liquid glass, which issues from the
middle of her spinners, and which is so elastic that it is
capable of great expansion and contraction: and if a
hole be made in it, it immediately closes again. Next
she spreads over her belly a pellicle of the same material,
and ascends to the surface. The precise mode in
which she transfers a bubble of air beneath this pellicle
is not accurately known; but from an observation made
by the ingenious author of the little work from which
this account is abstracted, he concludes that she draws
the air into her body by the anus, which she presents to
the surface of the pool, and then pumps it out from an
opening at the base of the belly between the pellicle and
that part of the body, the hairs of which keep it extended.
Clothed with this a√´rial mantle, which to the spectator
seems formed of resplendent quicksilver, she plunges to
the bottom, and, with as much dexterity as a chemist
transfers gas with a gas-holder, introduces her bubble of
air beneath the roof prepared for its reception. This
man&#339;uvre she repeats ten or twelve times, until at length
in about a quarter of an hour she has transported as
much air as suffices to expand her apartment to its intended
extent, and now finds herself in possession of a
little a√´rial edifice, I had almost said an enchanted palace,
affording her a commodious and dry retreat in the
very midst of the water. Here she reposes unmoved by
the storms that agitate the surface of the pool, and devours
her prey at ease and in safety. Both sexes form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
these lodgings. At a particular season of the year the
male quits his apartment, approaches that of the female,
enters it, and enlarging it by the bubble of air that he
carries with him, it becomes a common abode for the
happy pair<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>.&mdash;The spider which forms these singular
habitations is one of the largest European species, and
in some countries not uncommon in stagnant pools.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XV" id="LETTER_XV">LETTER XV.</a></h2>

<h3><i>HABITATIONS OF INSECTS
CONTINUED.</i></h3>


<p>The habitations of insects which I shall next proceed
to describe, are those formed by the united labour of
several individuals.</p>

<p>The societies which thus combine their operations may
be divided into two kinds: 1st, those of which the object
is simply the conservation of the individuals composing
them; and 2dly, those whose object is also the nurture
and education of their young. To the last head belong
bees, wasps, &amp;c.: to the former the larv√¶ of some species
of moths, whose labours being the most simple I shall
first describe.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You cannot fail to have observed in gardens the fruit-trees
disfigured, as you would probably think them, with
what at first view seem very strong and thick spiders'
webs. If you have bestowed upon these webs the slightest
attention, you must have likewise remarked that they
differ very materially in their construction from those
spun by spiders, inclosing on every side an angular
space, and being besides filled with caterpillars. These
are the larv√¶ of <i>Arctia chrysorrh&#339;a</i>, and the web which
contains them is spun by their united labour for the protection
of the common society. As soon as the cluster of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
eggs deposited by the parent moth is hatched, the young
caterpillars, to the number of three or four hundred,
commence their operations. At first they content themselves
by forming a sort of hammock of the single leaf
upon which they find themselves assembled, covering it
with a roof composed of a number of silken threads drawn
from one edge to the other; and under one or more of
these temporary habitations they reside for a few days,
until they are become large and strong enough to undertake
a more solid and spacious building sufficient to contain
the whole society. In constructing this new habitation,
they spin a close silken web round the end of two or
three adjoining twigs and the leaves attached to them, so
as to include the requisite space. They are not curious
in giving any particular form to the edifice: sometimes
it is flat, often roundish, but always more or less angular.
The interior is divided by partitions of silk into several
irregular apartments, to each of which there is purposely
left an appropriate door. Within these the caterpillars
retire at night, or in rainy weather, quitting the nest on
fine days, and dispersing themselves over the neigbouring
leaves, upon which they feed. Here too they repose
during the critical period of the change of their skins.
On the approach of winter the whole community shut
themselves up in the nest, which, by the addition of repeated
layers of silk, has at this time become so thick and
strong as to be impervious to the wind and rain. They
remain in a state of torpidity during the cold months,
but towards the beginning of April are awakened to activity
by the genial breath of spring, and begin to feed
with greediness upon the young leaves that surround their
habitation, which, as they soon greatly increase in size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
they find it necessary to enlarge. One might fear that
a structure formed of such materials would at this period
be sadly damaged by the growth of the young shoots
and leaves of the twigs which it incloses; but the inhabitants,
as if to guard against such an accident, have
gnawed off all the buds within their dwelling, and thus
secured themselves from this inconvenience<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>.</p>

<p>The nest of the larv√¶ of another species of moth, the
<i>Lasiocampa processionea</i>, unfortunately not a native of
this country, to which on account of their singular manners,
that will be detailed to you in a subsequent letter,
Reaumur has given the title of <i>processionary</i> caterpillars,
is somewhat different in its construction from that just
described, though formed of the same material. As the
caterpillars which fabricate it feed upon the leaves of
the oak, it is always found upon this tree, attached not
to the branches but the trunk, sometimes at a considerable
height from the ground. In shape it resembles
an irregular knob or protuberance, and the silk which
composes it being of a gray colour, at a distance it would
be taken for a mass of lichens. Sometimes this nest is
upwards of eighteen inches long, and six broad, rising in
the middle about four inches from the surface of the tree.
Between the trunk and the silken covering, a single hole
is left which serves for the entrance and exit of the inhabitants.
These differ in their manners from those last
mentioned. While very young they have no fixed habitation,
contenting themselves with a succession of different
temporary camps until they have attained two-thirds
of their growth. Then it is they unite their labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
in spinning the nest just described; and in this they
continue to reside in harmony until they become perfect
insects, assuming in it even the state of chrysalis<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>.</p>

<p>Habitations similar, as to their general structure, to
the above, though differing in several minute circumstances,
are formed by the larv√¶ of several other moths,
as of <i>Arctia ph√¶orrh&#339;a</i> of Curtis, <i>Trichoda neustria</i>, &amp;c.
as well as those of <i>Vanessa Io</i>, <i>Melit√¶a Cinxia</i>, and
some other butterflies: and even of some saw-flies (<i>serrifera</i>),
which, however, have each a separate silken covering.
But as it would be tedious to describe these
particularly, I pass on to the habitations formed by insects
in their perfect state, which have in view the education
of their young as well as self-preservation, describing
in succession those of <i>ants</i>, <i>bees</i>, <i>wasps</i>, and
<i>white-ants</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of these the most simple in their structure are the
nests of different kinds of <i>ants</i>, many of which externally
present the appearance of hillocks more or less
conical, formed of earth or other substances.</p>

<p>The nest of the large red or horse ants (<i>F. rufa</i>,) which
are common in woods, at the first aspect seems a very
confused mass. Exteriorly it is a conical mount composed
of pieces of straw, fragments of wood, little stones, leaves,
grain; in short, of any portable materials within their
reach. But however rude its outward appearance, and the
articles of which it consists, interiorly it presents an arrangement
admirably calculated at once for protection
against the excessive heat of the sun, and yet to retain
a due degree of genial warmth. It is wholly composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
of numerous small apartments of different sizes, communicating
with each other by means of galleries and arranged
in separate stories, some very deep in the earth,
others a considerable height above it: the former for the
reception of the young in cold weather and at night, the
latter adapted to their use in the day time. In forming
these, the ants mix the earth excavated from the bottom
of the nest with the other materials of which the mount
consists, and thus give solidity to the whole. Besides
the avenues which join the apartments together, other
galleries varying in dimensions communicate with the
outside of the nest at the top of the mount. These open
doors would seem ill calculated for precluding the admission
of wet or of nocturnal enemies: but the ants alter
their dimensions continually according to circumstances;
and they wholly close them at night, when all gradually
retire to the interior, and a few sentinels only are left to
guard the gates. On rainy days, too, they keep them
shut, and when the sky is cloudy open them partially<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>.</p>

<p>The habitations of these ants are much larger than
those of any other species in this country, and sometimes
as big as a small haycock; but they are mere molehills
when compared with the enormous mounds which other
species apparently of the same family, but much larger,
construct in warmer climates. Malouet states, that in
the forests of Guiana he once saw ant-hills which, though
his companion would not suffer him to approach nearer
than forty paces for fear of his being devoured, seemed
to him to be fifteen or twenty feet high, and thirty or
forty in diameter at the base, assuming the form of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
pyramid, truncated at one-third of its height<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>, and Stedman,
when in Surinam, once passed ant-hills six feet
high, and at least one hundred feet in circumference<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>.</p>

<p>The nest of <i>Formica brunnea</i> is composed wholly of
earth, and consists of a great number of stories, sometimes
not fewer than forty, twenty below the level of the
soil, and as many above, which last, following the slope
of the ant-hill, are concentric. Each story, separately
examined, exhibits cavities in the shape of saloons, narrower
apartments, and long galleries which preserve the
communication between both. The arched roofs of the
most spacious rooms are supported by very thin walls,
or occasionally by small pillars and true buttresses; some
having only one entrance from above, others a second
communicating with the lower story. The main galleries,
of which in some places several meet in one large
saloon, communicate with other subterranean passages,
which are often carried to the distance of several feet
from the hill.&mdash;These insects work chiefly after sunset.&mdash;In
building their nest they employ soft clay only, scraped
from its bottom when sufficiently moistened by a shower,
which, far from injuring, consolidates and strengthens
their architecture. Different labourers convey small
masses of this ductile material between their mandibles,
and with the same instruments they spread and mould
it to their will, the antenn√¶ accompanying every movement.
They render all firm by pressing the surface
lightly with their fore feet; and however numerous the
masses of clay composing these walls, and though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
connected by no glutinous material, they appear when finished
one single layer well united, consolidated, and smoothed.
Having traced the plan of their structure, by placing
here and there the foundations of the pillars and partition-walls,
they add successively new portions: and when
the walls of a gallery or apartment which are half a line
thick are elevated about half an inch in height, they join
them by springing a flattish arch or roof from one side
to the other. Nothing can be a more interesting spectacle
than one of these cities while building. In one
place vertical walls form the outline, which communicate
with different corridors by openings made in the
masonry; in another we see a true saloon whose vaults
are supported by numerous pillars; and further on are
the cross ways or squares where several streets meet, and
whose roofs, though often more than two inches across,
the ants are under no difficulty in constructing, beginning
the sides of the arch in the angle formed by two
walls, and extending them by successive layers of clay
till they meet; while crowds of masons arrive from all
parts with their particle of mortar, and work with a regularity,
harmony, and activity, which can never enough
be admired. So assiduous are they in their operations,
that they will complete a story with all its saloons, vaulted
roofs, partitions and galleries, in seven or eight hours.
If they begin a story, and for want of moisture are unable
to finish it, they pull down again all the crumbling
apartments that are not covered in<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>.</p>

<p>Another species of ants (<i>F. fusca</i>) are also masons.
When they wish to heighten their habitations, they begin
by covering the top with a thick layer of clay which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
they transport from the interior. In this layer they trace
out the plan of the new story, first hollowing out little
cavities of almost equal depth at different distances from
each other, and of a size adapted to their purposes.
The elevations of earth left between them serve for bases
to the interior walls, which, when they have removed all
the loose earth from the floors of the apartments, and reduced
the foundations to a due thickness, they heighten,
and lastly cover all in. M. Huber saw a single working
ant make and cover in a gallery which was two or three
inches long, and of which the interior was rendered perfectly
concave, without assistance<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>.</p>

<p>The societies of <i>F. fuliginosa</i> make their habitations
in the trunks of old oaks or willow-trees, gnawing the
wood into numberless stories more or less horizontal,
the ceilings and floors of which are about five or six
lines asunder, black, and as thin as card, sometimes
supported by vertical partitions, forming an infinity of
apartments which communicate by small apertures; at
others by small light cylindrical pillars furnished with a
base and capital which are arranged in colonnades, leaving
a communication perfectly free throughout the whole

<p>Two other tribes of carpenter ants (<i>F. √¶thiops</i> and

former applies this material only to the building of walls

<p>The most profound philosopher, equally with the
most incurious of mortals, is struck with astonishment
on inspecting the interior of a <i>bee-hive</i>. He beholds a
city in miniature. He sees this city divided into regular
streets, these streets composed of houses constructed on
the most exact geometrical principles and the most symmetrical
plan, some serving for store-houses for food,
others for the habitations of the citizens, and a few, much
more extensive than the rest, destined for the palaces of
the sovereign. He perceives that the substance of which
the whole city is built, is one which man, with all his
skill, is unable to fabricate; and that the edifices in which
it is employed are such, as the most expert artist would
find himself incompetent to erect. And the whole is the
work of a society of insects! "<i>Quel ab√Æme</i> (he exclaims
with Bonnet) <i>aux yeux du sage qu'une ruche d'Abeilles!
Quelle sagesse profonde se cache dans cet ab√Æme! Quel
philosophe osera le fonder!</i>" Nor have its mysteries yet
been fathomed. Philosophers have in all ages devoted
their lives to the subject; from Aristomachus of Soli in
Cilicia, who, we are told by Pliny, for fifty-eight years
attended solely to bees, and Philiscus the Thracian, who
spent his whole time in forests investigating their manners,
to Swammerdam, Reaumur, Hunter, and Huber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
of modern times. Still the construction of the combs of
a bee-hive is a miracle which overwhelms our faculties.</p>

<p>You are probably aware that the hives with which we
provide bees are not essential to their labours, and
that they can equally form their city in the hollow of a
tree or any other cavity. In whatever situation it is
placed, the general plan which they follow is the same.
You have seen a honey-comb, and must have observed
that it is a flattish cake, composed of a vast number of
cells, for the most part hexagonal, regularly applied to
each other's sides, and arranged in two strata or layers
placed end to end. The interior of a bee-hive, consists of
several of these combs fixed to its upper part and sides,
arranged <i>vertically</i> at a small distance from each other,
so that the cells composing them are placed in a horizontal
position, and have their openings in opposite directions&mdash;not
the best position one would have thought
for retaining a fluid like honey, yet the bees find no inconvenience
on this score. The distance of the combs
from each other is about half an inch, that is, sufficient
to allow two bees busied upon the opposite cells to pass
each other with facility. Besides these vacancies, which
form the high roads of their community, the combs are
here and there pierced with holes which serve as posterns
for easy communication from one to the other without
losing time by going round.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the combs is well adapted for
its purpose, but it is the construction of the cells which
is most admirable and astonishing. As these are formed
of wax, a substance secreted by the bees in no great
abundance, it is important that as little as possible of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
such a precious material should be consumed. Bees,
therefore, in the formation of their cells have to solve
a problem which would puzzle some geometers, namely,
a quantity of wax being given, to form of it similar and
equal cells of a determinate capacity, but of the largest
size in proportion to the quantity of matter employed,
and disposed in such a manner as to occupy in the hive
the least possible space. Every part of this problem is
practically solved by bees. If their cells had been cylindrical,
which form seems best adapted to the shape
of a bee, they could not have been applied to each
other without leaving numberless superfluous vacuities.
If the cells were made square or triangular, this last
objection, indeed, would be removed; but besides that
a greater quantity of wax would have been required,
the shape would have been inconvenient to a cylindrical-bodied
animal. All these difficulties are obviated by
the adoption of hexagonal cells, which are admirably
fitted to the form of the insect, at the same time that
their sides apply to each other without the smallest vacant
intervals.&mdash;Another important saving in materials
is gained by making a common base serve for two strata
of cells. Much more wax as well as room would have
been required, had the combs consisted of a single stratum
only. But this is not all. The base of each cell
is not an exact plane, but is usually composed of three
rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped pieces, placed so as to
form a pyramidal concavity. From this form it follows
that the base of a cell on one side or stratum of the
comb is composed of portions of the bases of <i>three</i> cells
on the other. You will inquire, Where is the advantage
of this arrangement? First, a greater degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
strength; and secondly, precisely the same as results
from the hexagonal sides&mdash;a greater capacity with less
expenditure of wax. Not only has this been indisputably
ascertained, but that the angles of the base of the cell
are exactly those which require the smallest quantity of
wax. It is obvious that these angles might vary infinitely;
but by a very accurate admeasurement Maraldi
found, that the great angles were in general 109¬∞ 28',
the smaller ones 70¬∞ 32'. Reaumur ingeniously suspecting
that the object of choosing these angles from amongst
so many was to spare wax, proposed to M. K&#339;nig, a
skilful geometrician, who was ignorant of Maraldi's experiments,
to determine by calculations what ought to
be the angle of a hexagonal cell, with a pyramidal bottom
formed of three similar and equal rhomboid plates,
so that the least matter possible might enter into its construction.
For the solution of this problem the geometrician
had recourse to the infinitesimal calculus, and
found that the great angles of the rhombs should be
109¬∞ 26', and of the small angles 70¬∞ 34'<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>. What a
surprising agreement between the solution of the problem
and the actual admeasurement<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>!</p>

<p>Besides the saving of wax effected by the form of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
cells, the bees adopt another economical plan suited to
the same end. They compose the bottoms and sides of
wax of very great tenuity, not thicker than a sheet of
writing-paper. But as walls of this thinness at the entrance
would be perpetually injured by the ingress and
egress of the workers, they prudently make the margin
at the opening of each cell three or four times thicker
than the walls. Dr. Barclay has recently discovered
that though of such excessive tenuity, the sides and bottom
of each cell are actually <i>double</i>, or, in other words,
that each cell is a distinct, separate, and in some measure
an independent structure, agglutinated only to the
neighbouring cells, and that when the agglutinating substance
is destroyed, each cell may be entirely separated
from the rest<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>.</p>

<p>You must not imagine that all the cells of a hive are
of precisely similar dimensions. As the society consists
of three orders of insects differing in size, the cells which
are to contain the larv√¶ of each proportionally differ,
those built for the males being considerably larger than
those which are intended for the workers. The abode
of the larv√¶ of the queen bee differs still more. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
not only much larger than any of the rest, but of a quite
different form, being shaped like a pear or Florence
flask, and composed of a material much coarser than
common wax, of which above one hundred times as
much is used in its construction as of pure wax in that
of a common cell. The situation, too, of these cells (for
there are generally three or four, and sometimes many
more, even up to thirty or forty, in each hive) is very
different from that of the common cells. Instead of
being in a horizontal they are placed in a vertical direction,
with the mouth downwards, and are usually fixed
to the lower edge of the combs, from which they irregularly
project like stalactites from the roof of a cavern.&mdash;The
cells destined for the reception of honey and
pollen, differ from those which the larv√¶ of the males
and workers inhabit, only, by being deeper, and thus
more capacious; in fact, the very same cells are successively
applied to both purposes. When the honey is
collected in great abundance, and there is not time to
construct fresh cells, the bees lengthen the honey cells
by adding a rim to them.</p>

<p>You will be anxious to learn the process which these
ingenious artificers follow in constructing their habitations:
and on this head I am happy that the recent publication
of a new edition of the celebrated Huber's <i>New
Observations on Bees</i>, in which this subject is for the first
time elucidated, will enable me to gratify your curiosity.</p>

<p>But in the first place you must be told of an important
and unlooked-for discovery of this unrivalled detector of
the hidden mysteries of nature&mdash;that the workers or neuters,
as they are called, of a hive, consist of two descriptions
of individuals, one of which he calls <i>abeilles nourrices</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
or <i>petites abeilles</i>, the other <i>abeilles ciri√®res</i>.&mdash;The
former, or <i>nurse-bees</i>, are smaller than the latter; their
stomach is not capable of such distention; and their
office is to build the combs and cells after the foundation
has been laid by the <i>ciri√®res</i>; to collect honey; and to
feed the larv√¶. The <i>abeilles ciri√®res</i> are the makers of
wax, which substance Huber has now indisputably ascertained
to be secreted, as John Hunter long ago suspected,
beneath the ventral segments, from between which
it is taken by the bees when wanted, in the form of thin
scales. The apparatus in which the wax is secreted
consists of four pair of membranous bags or <i>wax-pockets</i>
situated at the base of each intermediate segment, one on
each side, which can only be seen by pressing the abdomen
so as to lengthen it, being usually concealed by the
over-lapping of the preceding segments. It should be
observed that this discovery was nearly made by our
countryman Thorley, who in his <i>Female Monarchy</i> (1744)
says that he has taken bees with six pieces of wax within
the plaits of the abdomen, three on each side. In these
pockets the wax is secreted by some unknown process
from the food taken into the stomach, which in the wax-making
bees is much larger than in the nurse-bees, and
afterwards transpires through the membrane of the wax-pocket
in thin lamin√¶. The nurse-bees, however, do
secrete wax, but in very small quantities.&mdash;When wax
is not wanted in the hive, the wax-makers disgorge their
honey into the cells.</p>

<p>The process of building the combs in a bee-hive, as
observed by Huber, is as follows:</p>

<p>The wax-makers having taken a due portion of honey
or sugar, from either of which wax can be elaborated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
suspend themselves to each other, the claws of the fore-legs
of the lowermost being attached to those of the hind
pair of the uppermost, and form themselves into a cluster,
the exterior layer of which looks like a kind of curtain.
This cluster consists of a series of festoons or
garlands, which cross each other in all directions, and
in which most of the bees turn their back upon the observer:
the curtain has no other motion than what it
receives from the interior layers, the fluctuations of
which are communicated to it.&mdash;All this time the <i>nurse-bees</i>
preserve their wonted activity and pursue their usual
employments.&mdash;The wax-makers remain immoveable for
about twenty-four hours, during which period the formation
of wax takes place, and thin lamin√¶ of this material
may be generally perceived under their abdomen. One
of these bees is now seen to detach itself from one of the
central garlands of the cluster, to make a way amongst
its companions to the middle of the vault or top of the
hive, and by turning itself round to form a kind of void,
in which it can move itself freely. It then suspends itself
to the centre of the space, which it has cleared, the diameter
of which is about an inch. It next seizes one of
the lamin√¶ of wax with a pincer formed by the posterior
metatarsus and tibia<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>, and drawing it from beneath the
abdominal segment, one of the anterior legs takes it with
its claws and carries it to the mouth. This leg holds
the lamina with its claws vertically, the tongue rolled up
serving for a support, and by elevating or depressing it
at will, causes the whole of its circumference to be exposed
to the action of the mandibles, so that the margin
is soon gnawed into pieces, which drop as they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
detached into the double cavity, bordered with hairs, of the
mandibles. These fragments, pressed by others newly
separated, fall on one side of the mouth, and issue from
it in the form of a very narrow ribband. They are then
presented to the tongue, which impregnates them with a
frothy liquor like a <i>bouillie</i>. During this operation the
tongue assumes all sorts of forms; sometimes it is flattened
like a spatula; then like a trowel, which applies
itself to the ribband of wax; at other times it resembles
a pencil terminating in a point. After having moistened
the whole of the ribband, the tongue pushes it so as to
make it re-enter the mandibles, but in an opposite direction,
where it is worked up anew. The liquor mixed
with the wax communicates to it a whiteness and opacity
which it had not before; and the object of this mixture
of <i>bouillie</i>, which did not escape the observation of Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>,
is doubtless to give it that ductility and tenacity,
which it possesses in its perfect state.</p>

<p>The foundress-bee, a name which this first beginner
of a comb deserves, next applies these prepared parcels
of wax against the vault of the hive, disposing them with
the point of her mandibles in the direction which she
wishes them to take: and she continues these man&#339;uvres
until she has employed the whole lamina that she had
separated from her body, when she takes a second, proceeding
in the same manner. She gives herself no care
to compress the molecules of wax which she has heaped
together; she is satisfied if they adhere to each other.
At length she leaves her work, and is lost in the crowd
of her companions. Another succeeds, and resumes the
employment; then a third; all follow the same plan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
placing their little masses; and if any by chance gives
them a contrary direction, another coming removes them
to their proper place. The result of all these operations
is a mass or little wall of wax with uneven surfaces, five
or six lines long, two lines high, and half a line thick,
which descends perpendicularly below the vault of the
hive. In this first work is no angle nor any trace of the
figure of the cells. It is a simple partition in a right
line without any inflection.</p>

<p>The wax-makers having thus laid the foundation of a
comb, are succeeded by the nurse-bees, which are alone
competent to model and perfect the work. The former
are the labourers, who convey the stone and mortar; the
latter the masons, who work them up into the form which
the intended structure requires. One of the nurse-bees
now places itself horizontally on the vault of the hive, its
head corresponding to the centre of the mass or wall
which the wax-makers have left, and which is to form
the partition of the comb into two opposite assemblages
of cells; and with its mandibles, rapidly moving its head,
it moulds in that side of the wall a cavity which is to form
the base of one of the cells to the diameter of which it is
equal. When it has worked some minutes it departs,
and another takes its place, deepening the cavity, heightening
its lateral margins by heaping up the wax to right
and left by means of its teeth and fore-feet, and giving
them a more upright form. More than twenty bees
successively employ themselves in this work. When
arrived at a certain point, other bees begin on the yet
untouched and opposite side of the mass; and commencing
the bottom of <i>two</i> cells, are in turn relieved by
others. While still engaged in this labour, the wax-makers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
return and add to the mass, augmenting its extent
every way, the nurse-bees again continuing their
operations.&mdash;After having worked the bottoms of the
cells of the first row into their proper forms, they polish
them and give them their finish, while others begin the
outline of a new series.</p>

<p>The cells themselves, or prisms which result from the
re-union and meeting of the sides, are next constructed.
These are engrafted on the borders of the cavities hollowed
in the mass. The bees begin them by making
the contour of the bottoms, which at first is unequal, of
equal height: thus all the margins of the cells offer an
uniformly level surface from their first origin, and until
they have acquired their proper length. The sides are
heightened in an order analogous to that which the insects
follow in finishing the bottoms of the cells; and the
length of these tubes is so perfectly proportioned that
there is no observable inequality between them.&mdash;It is
to be remarked, that though the general form of the
cells is hexagonal, that of those first begun is <i>pentagonal</i>,
the side next the top of the hive, and by which the comb
is attached, being much broader than the rest; whence
the comb is more strongly united to the hive than if these
cells were of the ordinary shape. It of course follows
that the base of these cells, instead of being formed like
those of the hexagonal cells of three rhomboids, consists
of one rhomboid and two trapeziums.</p>

<p>The form of a new comb is lenticular, its thickness
always diminishing towards the edges. This gradation
is constantly observable while it keeps enlarging in circumference;
but as soon as the bees get sufficient space
to lengthen it, it begins to lose this form and to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
parallel surfaces: it has then received the shape which it
will always preserve.</p>

<p>The bees appear to give the proper forms to the bottoms
of the cells by means of their antenn√¶, which extraordinary
organs they seem to employ as directors by
which their other instruments are instructed to execute
a very complex work. They do not remove a single
particle of wax until the antenn√¶ have explored the surface
that is to be sculptured. By the use of these organs,
which are so flexible and so readily applied to all parts,
however delicate, that they can perform the functions
of compasses in measuring very minute objects, they can
work in the dark, and raise those wonderful combs the
first production of insects.</p>

<p>Every part of the work appears a natural consequence
of that which precedes it, so that chance has no share in
the admirable results witnessed. The bees cannot depart
from their prescribed route, except in consequence
of particular circumstances which alter the basis of their
labour. The original mass of wax is never augmented
but by an uniform quantity; and what is most astonishing,
this augmentation is made by the wax-makers, who
are the depositaries of the primary matter, and possess
not the art of sculpturing the cells.</p>

<p>The bees never begin two masses for combs at the
same time; but scarcely are some rows of cells constructed
in the first, when two other masses, one on each
side of it, are established at equal distances from it and
parallel to it, and then again two more exterior to these.
The combs are always enlarged and lengthened in a
progression proportioned to the priority of their origin;
the middle comb being constantly advanced beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
two adjoining ones by some rows of cells, and they beyond
those that are exterior to them. Was it permitted
to these insects to lay the foundation of all their combs
at the same time, they could not be placed conveniently
or parallel to each other. So with respect to the cells, the
first cavity determines the place of all that succeed it.</p>

<p>A large number of bees work at the same time on the
same comb; but they are not moved to it by a simultaneous
but by a successive impulse. A single bee begins
every partial operation, and many others in succession
add their efforts to hers, each appearing to act individually
in a direction impressed either by the workers
who have preceded it, or by the condition in which it
finds the work. The whole population of wax-makers
is in a state of the most complete inaction till one bee
goes forth to lay the foundations of the first comb. Immediately
others second her intentions, adding to the
height and length of the mass; and when they cease to
act, a bee, if the term may be used, of another profession,
one of the nurse-bees, goes to form the draught of the
first cell, in which she is succeeded by others.</p>

<p>The diameters of the cells intended for the larv√¶ of
workers is always 2-2/5 lines, that of those meant for the
larv√¶ of the males or drones 3-1/3 lines. The male cells
are generally in the middle of the combs, or in their
sides; rarely in their upper part. They are never insulated,
but form a corresponding group on both sides
the comb. When the bees form male cells below those of
neuters, they construct many rows of intermediate ones,
the diameter of which augments progressively till it attains
that of a male cell; and they observe the same method
when they revert from male cells to those of neuters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
It appears to be the oviposition of the queen which decides
the kind of cells that are to be made: while she
lays the eggs of workers, no male cells are constructed;
but when she is about to lay the eggs of males, the neuters
appear to know it and act accordingly.&mdash;When there
is a very large harvest of honey, the bees increase the
diameter and even the length of their cells. At this
time many irregular combs may be seen with cells of
twelve, fifteen, and even eighteen lines in length. Sometimes
also they have occasion to shorten the cells. When
they wish to lengthen on old comb, the tubes of which
have acquired their full dimensions, they gradually diminish
the thickness of its edges, gnawing down the
sides of the cells till it assumes the lenticular form: they
then engraft a mass of wax round it, and so proceed
with new cells.</p>

<p>Variations, as has been already hinted, sometimes take
place in the position and even form of the combs. Occasionally
the bees construct cells of the common shape
upon the wood to which the combs are fixed, without
pyramidal bottoms, and from them continue their work
as usual. These cells with a flat bottom, or rather with
the wood for their bottom, are more irregular than the
common ones; some of their orifices are not angular,
and their dimensions are not exact, but all are more or
less hexagonal. Once when disturbed, Huber observed
them to begin their combs on one of the vertical sides
of the hive instead of on the roof. When particular
circumstances caused it, as, for instance, when glass was
introduced, to which they do not like to fix their combs,
he remarked that they constantly varied their direction;
and by repeating the attempt, he forced them to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
their combs in the most fantastic manner. Yet glass is
an artificial substance, against which instinct merely
cannot have provided them: there is nothing in hollow
trees, their natural habitation, resembling it.&mdash;When
they change the direction of their combs, they enlarge
the cells of one side to two or three times the diameter
of those of the other, which gives the requisite
curve.</p>

<p>To complete the detail of these interesting discoveries
of the elder Huber, I must lay before you the following
additional observations of his son.</p>

<p>The first base of the combs upon which the bees work
holds three or four cells, sometimes more.&mdash;The comb
continues of the same width for three or four inches,
and then begins to widen for three quarters of its length.
The bees engaged at the bottom lengthen it downwards;
those on the sides widen it to right and left; and those
which are employed above the thickest part extend its
dimensions upwards. The more a comb is enlarged below,
the more it is necessary that it should be enlarged
upwards to the top of the hive. The bees that are engaged
in lengthening the comb, work with more celerity
than those which increase its width; and those that ascend
or increase its width upwards, more slowly than
the rest. Hence it arises that it is longer than wide, and
narrower towards the top than towards the middle.&mdash;The
first formed cells are usually not so deep as those
in the middle; but when the comb is of a certain height,
they are in haste to lengthen these cells so essential to
the solidity of the whole, sometimes even making them
longer than the rest.&mdash;The cells are not perfectly horizontal;
they are almost always a little higher towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
their mouth than at their base, so that their axis is not
perpendicular to the partition that separates the two assemblages.
They sometimes vary from the horizontal
line more than 20¬∞, usually 4¬∞ or 5¬∞. When the bees
enlarge the diameter of the cells preparatory to the formation
of male cells, the bottoms often consist of two
rhomboids and two hexagons, the size and form of which
vary, and they correspond with four instead of three opposite
cells.&mdash;The works of bees are symmetrical less
perhaps in minute details than considered as a whole.
Sometimes, indeed, their combs have a fantastic form;
but this, if traced, will be found to be caused by circumstances:
one irregularity occasions another, and
both usually have their origin in the dispositions which
we make them adopt. The inconstancy of climate, too,
occasions frequent interruptions, and injures the symmetry
of the combs; for a work resumed is always less
perfect than one followed up until completed.</p>

<p>At first the substance of the cells is of a dead white,
semitransparent, soft, and though even, not smooth:
but in a few days it loses most of these qualities, or
rather acquires new ones; a yellow tint spreads over the
cells, particularly their interior surface: their edges become
thicker, and they have acquired a consistence,
which at first they did not possess. The combs also
when finished are heavier than the unfinished ones: these
last are broken by the slightest touch, whereas the former
will bend sooner than break. Their orifices also have
something adhesive, and they melt less readily; whence
it is evident that the finished combs contain something
not present in the unfinished ones. In examining the
orifice of the yellow cells, their contour appeared to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
younger Huber to be besmeared with a reddish varnish,
unctuous, strong-scented, and similar to, if not the same
as, <i>propolis</i>. Sometimes there were red threads in the interior,
which were also applied round the sides, rhombs,
or trapeziums. This solder, as it may be called, placed
at the point of contact of the different parts, and at the
summit of the angles formed by their meeting, seemed to
give solidity to the cells, round the axis of the longest of
which there were sometimes one or two red zones. From
subsequent experiments, M. Huber ascertained that this
substance was actually <i>propolis</i>, collected from the buds
of the poplar. He saw them with their mandibles draw
a thread from the mass of propolis that was most conveniently
situated, and breaking it by a sudden jerk of
the head, take it with the claws of their fore-legs, and
then, entering the cell, place it at the angles and sides, &amp;c.
which they had previously planished. The yellow colour,
however, is not given by the propolis, and it is not
certain to what it is owing.&mdash;The bees sometimes mix
wax and propolis and make an amalgam, known to the
ancients and called by them <i>Mitys</i> and <i>Pissoceros</i>, which
they use in rebuilding cells that have been destroyed,
in order to strengthen and support the edifice<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>.</p>

<p>We know but little of the proceedings of the species
of bees not indigenous to Europe, which live in societies
and construct combs like that cultivated by us. A traveller
in Brazil mentions one there which builds a kind
of natural hive: "On an excursion towards upper Tapagippe,"
says he, "and skirting the dreary woods which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
extend to the interior, I observed the trees more loaded
with bees' nests than even in the neighbourhood of
Porto Seguro. They consist of a ponderous shell of
clay, cemented similarly to martins' nests, swelling from
high trees about a foot thick, and forming an oval mass
full two feet in diameter. When broken, the wax is arranged
as in our hives, and the honey abundant<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Humble-bees</i> are the only tribe besides the hive-bee,
that in this part of the world construct nests by the united
labour of the society. The habitations composing them
are of a rude construction, and the streets are arranged
with little architectural regularity. The number of inhabitants,
too, is small, rarely exceeding two or three
hundred, and often not more than twenty. The nests
of some species, as of <i>Bombus</i><a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> <i>lapidaria</i>, <i>B. terrestris</i>,
&amp;c. are found under ground at the depth of a foot or
more below the surface; but as the internal structure of
these does not essentially differ from that of the more
singular habitations of <i>B. Muscorum</i>, and as some of the
subterranean species occasionally adopt the same situation,
I shall confine my description to the latter.</p>

<p>These nests, which do not exceed six or eight inches
in diameter, are generally found in meadows and pastures,
and sometimes in hedge-rows where the soil is
entangled with roots. The lower half occupies a cavity
in the soil, either accidentally found ready made, or excavated
with great labour by the bees. The upper part
or dome of the nest is composed of a thick felted covering
of moss, having the interior ceiling coated with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
thin roof of coarse wax for the purpose of keeping out
the wet. The entrance is in the lower part, and is generally
through a gallery or covered way, sometimes
more than a foot in length and half an inch in diameter,
by means of which the nest is more effectually concealed
from observation. On removing the coping of moss, the
interior presents to our view a very different scene from
that witnessed in a bee-hive. Instead of numerous vertical
combs of wax, we see merely a few irregular horizontal
combs placed one above the other, the uppermost
resting upon the more elevated parts of the lower, and
connected together by small pillars of wax. Each of
these combs consists of several groups of pale-yellow
oval bodies of three different sizes, those in the middle
being the largest, closely joined to each other, and each
group connected with those next it by slight joinings of
wax. These oval bodies are not, as you might suppose,
the work of the old bees, but the silken cocoons spun by
the young larv√¶. Some are closed at the upper extremity;
others, which chiefly occupy the lower combs,
have this part open. The former are those which yet
include their immature tenants; the latter are the empty
cases from which the young bees have escaped. On the
surface of the upper comb are seen several masses of wax
of a flattened spheroidal shape, and of very various dimensions:
some above an inch and others not a quarter
of an inch in diameter: which on being opened are found
to include a number of larv√¶ surrounded with a supply
of pollen moistened with honey. These, which are the
true cells, are chiefly the work of the female, which after
depositing her eggs in them furnishes them with a store
of pollen and honey; and, when this is consumed, supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
the larv√¶ with a daily provision, as has been described
in a former letter, until they are sufficiently
grown to spin the cocoons before spoken of. Lastly, in
all the corners of the combs, and especially in the middle,
we observe a considerable number of small goblet-like
vessels, filled with honey and pollen, which are not,
as in the case of the hive-bee, the fabrication of the
workers, but are chiefly the empty cocoons left by the
larv√¶. It falls to the workers, however, to cut off the
fragments of silk from the orifice of the cocoon, which,
after giving it a regular circular form, they strengthen
by a ring or elevated tube of wax made in a different
shape by different species; and to coat them internally
with a lining of the same material. They even occasionally
construct honey-pots entirely of wax<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a>.</p>

<p>The most curious circumstance in the construction of
these nests, is the mode in which the bees transport the
moss employed in forming the roof. When they have
discovered a parcel of this material conveniently situated
upon the ground, five or six insects place themselves
upon it in a file, turning the hinder part of their bodies
towards the quarter to which it is meant to be conveyed.
The first takes a small portion, and with its jaws and
fore-legs as it were felts it together. When the fibres
are sufficiently entangled, it pushes them under its body
by means of the first pair of legs; the intermediate pair
receives the moss, and delivers it to the last, which protrudes
it as far as possible beyond the anus. When by
this process the insect has formed behind it a small ball
of well-carded moss, the next bee pushes it to the third,
which consigns it in like manner to that behind it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
thus the balls are conveyed to the foot of the nest, and
from thence elevated to the summit, much in the same
way that a file of labourers transfer a parcel of cheeses
from a vessel or cart to a warehouse<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>. It is easy to perceive
that a vast saving of time must ensue from this
well contrived division of labour; the structure rising
much more rapidly than if every individual had been
employed first in carding his materials, and then in
transferring them to the spot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Wasps</i>, though ferocious and cruel towards their fellow-insects,
are civilized and polished in their intercourse
with each other, and form a community whose
architectural labours will not suffer on comparison even
with those of the peaceful inhabitants of a bee-hive.
Like these, the great object of their industry is the erection
of a structure for their beloved progeny, towards
which they discover the greatest tenderness and affection,
and they even in like manner construct combs consisting
of hexagonal cells for their reception; but the
substance which they make use of is very dissimilar to
the wax employed by bees, and the general plan of their
city differs in many respects from that of a bee-hive.</p>

<p>The common wasp's nest, usually situated in a cavity
under ground, is of an oval figure about sixteen or
eighteen inches long by twelve or thirteen broad. Externally
it is surrounded by a thick coating of numerous
leaves of a sort of grayish paper, which do not touch
each other, but have a small interval between each, so
that if the rain should chance to penetrate one or two of
them, its progress is speedily arrested. On removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
this external covering, we perceive that the interior consists
of from twelve to fifteen circular combs of different
sizes, not ranged vertically as in a bee-hive, but horizontally,
so as to form so many distinct and parallel stories.
Each comb is composed of a numerous assemblage
of hexagonal cells formed of the same paper-like
substance as the exterior covering of the nest, and according
to a discovery of Dr. Barclay, each, as in those
of bees, a distinct cell, the partition walls being double<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a>.
These cells, which, as wasps do not store up any food,
serve merely as the habitations of their young, are not,
like those of the honey-bee, arranged in two opposite
layers, but in one only, their entrance being always
downwards: consequently the upper part of the comb,
composed of the bases of the cells, which are not pyramidal
but slightly convex, forms a nearly level floor, on
which the inhabitants can conveniently pass and repass,
spaces of about half an inch high being left between
each comb. Although the combs are fixed to the sides
of the nest, they would not be sufficiently strong without
further support. The ingenious builders, therefore, connect
each comb to that below it by a number of strong
cylindrical columns or pillars, having according to the
rules of architecture their base and capital wider than
the shaft, and composed of the same paper-like material
used in other parts of the nest, but of a more compact
substance. The middle combs are connected by a rustic
colonnade of from forty to fifty of these pillars; the upper
and lower combs by a smaller number.</p>

<p>The cells, which in a populous nest are not fewer than
16,000, are of different sizes, corresponding to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
the three orders of individuals which compose the community;
the largest for the grubs of females, the smallest
for those of workers. The last always occupy an entire
comb, while the cells of the males and females are often
intermixed.&mdash;Besides openings which are left between
the walls of the combs to admit of access from one to
the other, there are at the bottom of each nest two holes,
by one of which the wasps uniformly enter, and through
the other issue from the nest, and thus avoid all confusion
or interruption of their common labours. As the
nest is often a foot and a half under ground, it is requisite
that a covered way should lead to its entrance. This
is excavated by the wasps, who are excellent miners, and
is often very long and tortuous, forming a beaten road
to the subterranean city, well known to the inhabitants
though its entrance is concealed from incurious eyes.
The cavity itself which contains the nest is either the
abandoned habitation of moles or field-mice, or a cavern
purposely dug out by the wasps, which exert themselves
with such industry as to accomplish the arduous undertaking
in a few days.</p>

<p>When the cavity and entrance to it are completed,
the next part of the process is to lay the foundations of
the city to be included in it, which, contrary to the
usual custom of builders, wasps begin at the top, continuing
downwards. I have already told you that the
coatings which compose the dome are a sort of rough
but thin paper, and that the rest of the nest is composed
of the same substance variously applied. "Whence,"
you will inquire, "do the wasps derive it?" They are
manufacturers of the article, and prepare it from a material
even more singular than any of those which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
of late been proposed for this purpose; namely, the fibres
of wood<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>. These they detach by means of their jaws
from window-frames, posts and rails, &amp;c., and, when
they have amassed a heap of the filament, moisten the
whole with a few drops of a viscid glue from their mouth,
and, kneading it with their jaws into a sort of paste or
<i>papier m√¢ch√©</i>, fly off with it to their nest. This ductile
mass they attach to that part of the building upon which
they are at work, walking backwards and spreading it
into lamin√¶ of the requisite thinness by means of their
jaws, tongue, and legs. This operation is repeated
several times, until at length, by aid of fresh supplies of
the material and the combined exertions of so many
workmen, the proper number of layers of paper that are
to compose the roof is finished. This paper is as thin
as that of the letter which you are reading; and you
may form an idea of the labour which even the exterior
of a wasp's nest requires, on being told that not fewer
than fifteen or sixteen sheets of it are usually placed above
each other with slight intervening spaces, making the
whole upwards of an inch and a half in thickness. When
the dome is completed, the uppermost comb is next begun,
in which, as well as all the other parts of the building,
precisely the same material and the same process,
with little variation, are employed. In the structure of
the connecting pillars there seems a greater quantity of
glue made use of than in the rest of the work, doubtless
with the view of giving them a superior solidity.&mdash;When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
the first comb is finished, the continuation of the
roof or walls of the building is brought down lower; a
new comb is erected; and thus the work successively
proceeds until the whole is finished. As a comparatively
small proportion of the society is engaged in constructing
the nest, its entire completion is the work of several
months: yet, though the fruit of such severe labour, it
has scarcely been finished a few weeks before winter
comes on, when it merely serves for the abode of a few
benumbed females, and is entirely abandoned at the approach
of spring; wasps never using the same nest for
more than one season<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a>.</p>

<p>The nests of the hornet in their general construction
resemble those of the common wasp, but the paper of
which they are composed is of a much more rough texture;
the columns which support the comb are higher
and more massive; and that in the centre larger than
the rest.</p>

<p>These last, as well as wasps, conceal their nest, suspending
it in the corners of outhouses, &amp;c.; but there
are other species which construct their habitations in
open day-light, affixing them to the branches of shrubs
or trees.</p>

<p>One of these, described by Latreille, the work of
<i>Vespa holsatica</i>, a species not uncommon with us, resembles
in shape a cone of the cedar of Lebanon, and
is composed of an envelope and the comb, the former
consisting of three partial envelopes, each of the interior
of which is longer than the preceding. The comb comprises
about thirty hexagonal cells circularly arranged,
those of the circumference being lower and smaller<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span></p>

<p>A vespiary somewhat similar to the above, but of a
depressed globular figure, and composed of more numerous
envelopes, so as to assume a considerable resemblance
to a half-expanded Provence rose, is figured
by Reaumur<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>: and for a very beautiful specimen apparently
of the same kind (except that it contains but one
stage of cells), which was found in the garden at East-Dale,
I am indebted to the kindness of Henry Thompson,
esq. of Hull.</p>

<p>Another species (<i>Odynerus Parietum</i><a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>?) attaches its
small group of about twenty inverted crucible-like cells
to a piece of wood without any covering<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>.</p>

<p>But all these yield in point of singularity of structure
to the habitation of <i>Polistes nidulans</i>, a native of Cayenne,
which constructs its nest of a beautifully polished
white and solid pasteboard, impenetrable by the weather.
These are in shape somewhat like a bell, often a
foot and a half long, and fixed by their upper end to the
branch of a tree from which they are securely suspended.
Their interior is composed of numerous concave
horizontal combs, with the openings of the cells turned
downwards, fastened to the sides without any pillars,
and having a hole through each to admit of access to the
uppermost<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I close my account of the habitations of insects with
the description of those constructed by the white ants or
<i>Termites</i>, a tribe alluded to in former letters.</p>

<p>The different species, which are numerous, build
nests of very various forms. Some (<i>T. atrox</i> and <i>mordax</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
construct upon the ground a cylindrical turret of
clay about three quarters of a yard high, surrounded by
a projecting conical roof, so as in shape considerably to
resemble a mushroom, and composed interiorly of innumerable
cells of various figures and dimensions.
Others (as <i>T. Destructor</i>, <i>T. Arborum</i>, Sm.) prefer a
more elevated site, and build their nests, which are of
different sizes, from that of a hat to that of a sugar-cask,
and composed of pieces of wood glued together, amongst
the branches of trees often seventy or eighty feet high.
But by far the most curious habitations, and to which,
therefore, I shall confine a minute description, are those
formed by the <i>Termes fatalis</i>, a species very common in
Guinea and other parts of the coast of Africa, of whose
proceedings we have a very particular and interesting
account in the 71st volume of the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
from the pen of Mr. Smeathman.</p>

<p>These nests are formed entirely of clay, and are generally
twelve feet high and broad in proportion, so that
when a cluster of them, as is often the case, are placed
together, they may be taken for an Indian village, and
are in fact sometimes larger than the huts which the natives
inhabit. The first process in the erection of these
singular structures, is the elevation of two or three turrets
of clay about a foot high, and in shape like a sugar-loaf.
These, which seem to be the scaffolds of the future
building, rapidly increase in number and height, until
at length being widened at the base, joined at the top
into one dome, and consolidated all round into a thick
wall of clay, they form a building of the size above mentioned,
and of the shape of a hay-cock, which when
clothed, as it generally soon becomes, with a coating of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
grass, it at a distance very much resembles. When the
building has assumed this its final form, the inner turrets,
all but the tops, which project like pinnacles from
different parts of it, are removed, and the clay employed
over again in other services.</p>

<p>It is the lower part alone of the building that is occupied
by the inhabitants. The upper portion or dome,
which is very strong and solid, is left empty, serving
principally as a defence from the vicissitudes of the
weather and the attacks of natural or accidental enemies,
and to keep up in the lower part a genial warmth
and moisture necessary to the hatching of the eggs and
cherishing of the young ones. The inhabited portion is
occupied by the <i>royal chamber</i>, or habitation of the
king and queen; the <i>nurseries</i> for the young; the <i>store-houses</i>
for food; and innumerable galleries, passages,
and empty rooms: arranged according to the following
plan.</p>

<p>In the centre of the building, just under the apex,
and nearly on a level with the surface of the ground, is
placed the royal chamber, an arched vault of a semi-oval
shape, or not unlike a long oven; at first not above
an inch long, but enlarged as the queen increases in
bulk to the length of eight inches or more. In this
apartment the king and queen constantly reside; and
from the smallness of the entrances, which are barely
large enough to admit their more diminutive subjects,
can never possibly come out; thus, like many human
potentates, purchasing their sovereignty at the dear
rate of the sacrifice of liberty. Immediately adjoining
the royal chamber, and surrounding it on all sides to
the extent of a foot or more, are placed what Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
Smeathman calls the <i>royal apartments</i>, an inextricable
labyrinth of innumerable arched rooms of different
shapes and sizes, either opening into each other or communicating
by common passages, and intended for the
accommodation of the soldiers and attendants, of whom
many thousands are always in waiting on their royal
master and mistress. Next to the royal apartments
come the <i>nurseries</i> and the <i>magazines</i>. The former are
invariably occupied by the eggs and young ones, and in
the infant state of the nest are placed close to the royal
chamber; but when the queen's augmented size requires
a larger apartment, as well as additional rooms
for the increased number of attendants wanted to remove
her eggs, the small nurseries are taken to pieces, rebuilt
at a greater distance a size bigger, and their number increased
at the same time. In substance they differ from
all the other apartments, being formed of particles of
wood apparently joined together with gums. A collection
of these compact, irregular, and small wooden
chambers, not one of which is half an inch in width, is
inclosed in a common chamber of clay sometimes as big
as a child's head.&mdash;Intermixed with the nurseries lie the
magazines, which are chambers of clay always well
stored with provisions, consisting of particles of wood,
gums, and the inspissated juices of plants.</p>

<p>These magazines and nurseries, separated by small
empty chambers and galleries, which run round them
or communicate from one to the other, are continued on
all sides to the outer wall of the building, and reach up
within it two-thirds or three-fourths of its height. They
do not, however, fill up the whole of the lower part of
the hill, but are confined to the sides, leaving an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
area in the middle, under the dome, very much resembling
the nave of an old cathedral, having its roof supported
by three or four very large Gothic arches, of
which those in the middle of the area are sometimes two
and three feet high, but as they recede on each side rapidly
diminish like the arches of aisles in perspective.
A flattish roof, imperforated in order to keep out the wet,
if the dome should chance to be injured, covers the top
of the assemblage of chambers, nurseries, &amp;c.; and the
area, which is a short height above the royal chamber,
has a flattish floor also water-proof, and so contrived as
to let any rain that may chance to get in run off into the
subterraneous passages.</p>

<p>These passages or galleries, which are of an astonishing
size, some being above a foot in diameter and perfectly
cylindrical, lined with the same kind of clay of
which the hill is composed, served originally, like the
catacombs of Paris, as the quarries whence the materials
of the building were derived, and afterwards as the grand
outlets by which the Termites carry on their depredations
at a distance from their habitations. They run in
a sloping direction under the bottom of the hill to the
depth of three or four feet, and then branching out horizontally
on every side, are carried under ground, near
to the surface, to a vast distance. At their entrance
into the interior they communicate with other smaller
galleries, which ascend the inside of the outer shell in a
spiral manner, and, winding round the whole building
to the top, intersect each other at different heights,
opening either immediately into the dome in various
places, and into the lower half of the building, or communicating
with every part of it by other smaller circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
or oval galleries of different diameters. The necessity for
the vast size of the main underground galleries evidently
arises from the circumstance of their being the great
thoroughfares for the inhabitants, by which they fetch
their clay, wood, water, or provision; and their spiral
and gradual ascent is requisite for the easy access of the
Termites, which cannot but with great difficulty ascend
a perpendicular. To avoid this inconvenience, in the
interior vertical parts of the building, a flat path-way,
half an inch wide, is often made to wind gradually, like
a road cut out of the side of a mountain, by which they
travel with great facility up ascents otherwise impracticable.
The same ingenious propensity to shorten their
labour seems to have given birth to a contrivance still
more extraordinary. This is a kind of bridge of one
vast arch, sprung from the floor of the area to the upper
apartments at the side of the building, which answers
the purpose of a flight of stairs, and must shorten the
distance exceedingly in transporting eggs from the royal
chambers to the upper nurseries, which in some hills
would be four or five feet in the straightest line, and
much more if carried through all the winding passages
which lead through the inner chambers and apartments.
Mr. Smeathman measured one of these bridges, which
was half an inch broad, a quarter of an inch thick, and
ten inches long, making the side of an elliptic arch of
proportionable size, so that it is wonderful it did not fall
over or break by its own weight before they got it joined
to the side of the column above. It was strengthened
by a small arch at the bottom, and had a hollow or
groove all the length of the upper surface, either made
purposely for the greater safety of the passengers, or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
worn by frequent treading. It is not the least surprising
circumstance attending this bridge, the Gothic arches
before spoken of, and in general all the arches of the
various galleries and apartments, that, as Mr. Smeathman
saw every reason for believing, the Termites <i>project</i>
their arches, and do not, as one would have supposed,
excavate them.</p>

<p>Consider what incredible labour and diligence, accompanied
by the most unremitting activity and the
most unwearied celerity of movement, must be necessary
to enable these creatures to accomplish, their size considered,
these truly gigantic works. That such diminutive
insects, for they are scarcely the fourth of an inch in
length, however numerous, should, in the space of three
or four years, be able to erect a building twelve feet
high and of a proportionable bulk, covered by a vast
dome, adorned without by numerous pinnacles and turrets,
and sheltering under its ample arch myriads of
vaulted apartments of various dimensions, and constructed
of different materials&mdash;that they should moreover
excavate, in different directions and at different
depths, innumerable subterranean roads or tunnels,
some twelve or thirteen inches in diameter, or throw
an arch of stone over other roads leading from the metropolis
into the adjoining country to the distance of
several hundred feet&mdash;that they should project and finish
the, for them, vast interior stair-cases or bridges lately
described&mdash;and, finally, that the millions necessary to
execute such Herculean labours, perpetually passing to
and fro, should never interrupt or interfere with each
other, is a miracle of nature, or rather of the Author of
nature, far exceeding the most boasted works and structures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
of man: for, did these creatures equal him in size,
retaining their usual instincts and activity, their buildings
would soar to the astonishing height of more than
half a mile, and their tunnels would expand to a magnificent
cylinder of more than three hundred feet in
diameter; before which the pyramids of Egypt and the
aqueducts of Rome would lose all their celebrity, and
dwindle into nothings<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>. So that when in the commencement
of my last letter I promised to introduce you to
insects whose labours produced edifices more astonishing
than those of the mightiest Egyptian monarchs, the pyramids,
my promise, whatever you then thought of it,
was the reverse of hyperbolical.</p>

the moths that fly into candles are called <i>saules</i> (souls), perhaps from
the old notion that the souls of the dead fly about at night in search

call them <i>ghosts</i> (geistchen).</p>

assume. These reptiles too, as well as snakes, cast their skin
by an operation somewhat similar to that in <i>larv√¶</i>. There is nothing,
however, in their metamorphoses at all resembling the <i>pupa</i> state
in insects.</p>

of America belong to the Linnean genus <i>Culex</i>; but the celebrated

that the <i>Culices</i>, which are equally numerous and annoying, are called
<i>Zancudoes</i>, which means <i>long legs</i>. The former, he says, are what the

<p><a name="Footnote_245_245" id="Footnote_245_245"></a><a href="#FNanchor_245_245"><span class="label">[245]</span></a> It is by no means clear that the <i>&#338;strus</i> of modern entomologists
is synonymous with the insects which the Greeks distinguish by that
name. Aristotle not only describes these as <i>blood-suckers</i> (<i>Hist. Animal.</i> l. viii. c. 11.) but also as furnished with a <i>strong proboscis</i> (l. iv.
c. 7.). He observes likewise that they are produced from an animal
inhabiting the <i>waters</i>, in the vicinity of which they most abound
(l. viii. c. 7.). And √Ülian (<i>Hist.</i> l. vi. c. 38.) gives nearly the same
account. Comparing the &#338;strus with the Myops (synonymous perhaps
with <i>Tabanus</i>, Latr., except that Aristotle affirms that its larv√¶
live in wood, l. v. c. 19,) he says, the &#338;strus for a fly is one of the
largest; it has a stiff and large sting, (meaning a proboscis,) and
emits a certain humming and harsh sound&mdash;but the Myops is like
the Cynomyia&mdash;it hums more loudly than the &#338;strus, though it has
a smaller sting.
</p>
<p>
These characters and circumstances do not at all agree with the
modern &#338;strus, which, so far from being a blood-sucker furnished
with a strong proboscis, has scarcely any mouth. It shuns also the
vicinity of water, to which our cattle generally fly as a refuge from
it. It seems more probable that the &#338;strus of Greece was related
to Bruce's <i>Zimb</i>, represented in his figure with a long proboscis,
which makes its appearance in the neighbourhood of rivers, and belongs
to the <i>Tabanid√¶</i>. For further information the reader should
consult Mr. W. S. MacLeay's learned paper on the insect called
<i>Oistros</i> and <i>Asilus</i> by the ancients. <i>Linn. Trans.</i> xiv. 353&mdash;.</p>

the following memorandum respecting <i>M. Melitt√¶</i> from my common-place-book,
May 7, 1812. On the flowers of Ficaria, Taraxacum
and Bellis, I found a great number of this insect, which seemed
extremely restless, running here and there over the flowers, and over
each other, with great swiftness mounting the anthers, and sometimes lifting themselves up above them, as if looking for something. One
or two of them leaped upon my hand. Near one of these flowers I
found a small <i>Andrena</i> or <i>Halictus</i>, upon which some of these creatures
were busy sucking the poor animal, so that it seemed unable to
fly away. When disclosed from the egg, I imagine they get on the top
of these flowers to attach themselves to any of the <i>Andrenid√¶</i> that may
alight on them, or come sufficiently near for them to leap on it.&mdash;K.</p>

recently converted from pasture ground. In the Botanic Garden
at Hull thus circumstanced a great proportion of the annuals sown
in 1813 were destroyed by it. A very simple and effectual remedy
in such cases was mentioned to me by Sir Joseph Banks. He recommended
that slices of potato stuck upon skewers should be buried
near the seeds sown, examined every day, and the wire-worms which
collect upon them in great numbers destroyed.
</p>
<p>
This plan of decoying destructive animals from our crops by offering
them more tempting food, is excellent, and deserves to be pursued
in other instances. It was very successfully employed in 1813
by J. M. Rodwell, Esq. of Barham Hall near Ipswich, one of the most
skilful and best informed agriculturists in the county of Suffolk, to
preserve some of his wheat-fields from the ravages of a small gray
slug, which threatened to demolish the plant. Having heard that
turnips had been used with success to entice the slugs from wheat, he
caused a sufficient quantity to dress eight acres to be got together;
and then, the tops being divided and the apples sliced, he directed
the pieces to be laid separately, dressing two stetches with them and
omitting two alternately, till the whole field of eight acres was gone
over. On the following morning he employed two women to examine
and free from the slugs, which they did into a measure, the tops and
slices; and when cleared they were laid upon those stetches that had
been omitted the day before. It was observed invariably, that in the
stetches dressed with the turnips no slugs were to be found upon the
wheat or crawling upon the land, though they abounded upon the
turnips; while on the undressed stetches they were to be seen in great numbers both on the wheat and on the land. The quantity
of slugs thus collected was near a bushel.&mdash;Mr. Rodwell is persuaded
that by this plan he saved his wheat from essential injury.</p>

completely brown as if they had suffered a three months drought,

foot of the dead turf being dug up, 210 grubs were counted in it!
and, what furnishes a striking proof of the prolific powers of these
insects, the next year it was difficult to find a single one.</p>

observed that delicious vegetable of the <i>cabbage</i> tribe so largely cultivated
there under the name of <i>Jets de choux</i>, and which in England we call <i>Brussels sprouts</i>, to be materially injured in the later stages
of its growth by the attacks of the <i>turnip-flea</i>, and other little beetles
of the same genus (<i>Haltica</i>), which were so numerous and so universally
prevalent, that I scarcely ever examined a full-grown plant
from which a vast number might not have been collected. Some
plants were almost black with them, the species most abundant being
of a dark √¶neous tinge. They had not merely eroded the cuticle
in various parts, so as to give the leaves a brown blistered appearance,
but had also eaten them into large holes, at the margin of
which I often saw them in the act of gnawing; and the stunted and
unhealthy appearance of the plants sufficiently indicated the injurious
effect of this interruption of the proper office of the sap. What
was particularly remarkable, considering the locomotive powers of
these insects, was that the young turnips, sown in August after the
wheat and rye, close to acres of Brussels sprouts, (which all round
Brussels are planted in the open fields among other crops,) infested
by myriads of these insects, were not more eaten by them than they
usually are in England, and produced good average crops. It would
seem, agreeably to a fact already mentioned, (see Vol. I. 4th Edit.
p. 389,) that they prefer the taste of leaves to which they have been
accustomed, to younger plants of the same natural family; and hence
perhaps the previous sowing of a crop of cabbage-plants in the
corner of a field meant for turnips, might allure and keep there the
great bulk of these insects present in the vicinity, until the turnips
were out of danger.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_318_318" id="Footnote_318_318"></a><a href="#FNanchor_318_318"><span class="label">[318]</span></a> Perhaps this fly is the same which Linn√© confounded with
<i>Tachina Larvarum</i>, which he says he had found in the roots of the
cabbage (<i>Syst. Nat.</i> 992. 78.) I say "<i>confounded</i>," because it is not
likely that the same species should be parasitic in an insect, and also
inhabit a vegetable.</p>



<p><a name="Footnote_319_319" id="Footnote_319_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_319_319"><span class="label">[319]</span></a> In lately examining, however, some young garden peas and beans
about four inches high, I observed the margins of the leaves to be
gnawed into deep scollops by a little weevil (<i>Sitona lineata</i>), of which
I found from two to eight on each pea and bean, and many in the
act of eating. Not only were the larger leaves of every plant thus
eroded, but in many cases the terminal young shoots and leaves were
apparently irreparably injured. I have often noticed this and another
of the short-snouted Curculios (<i>S. tibialis</i>) in great abundance in
pea and bean fields, but was not aware till now that either of them
was injurious to these plants. Probably both are so, but whether
the crop is materially affected by them must be left to further
inquiry.</p>

for instance, the <i>Curculio (Rynchites) Alliari√¶</i> of
Linn√© feeds upon the hawthorn, and <i>Curculio (Cryptorhynchus) Lapathi</i>
upon the willow (Curtis in <i>Linn. Trans.</i> i. 86.); but as <i>Alliaria</i>
is common in hawthorn hedges, and docks often grow under willows,
the mistake in question easily happened: when, however, such mistakes
are discovered, the <i>Trivial Name</i> ought certainly to be altered.</p>

which DeJean arranges it.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_330_330" id="Footnote_330_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_330_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> Fabricius seems to have regarded the saw-fly that feeds upon the
<i>sallow</i> (<i>Nematus Capre√¶</i>), not only as synonymous with that which
feeds upon the <i>osier</i>, but also with our little assailant of the <i>gooseberry</i>
and <i>currant</i>. Yet it is very evident from Reaumur's account,
whose accuracy may be depended upon, that they are all distinct species.
Fabricius's description of the <i>fly</i> agrees with the insect of the
gooseberry, but that which he has given of the <i>larva</i> belongs to the animal inhabiting the sallow. Probably, confounding the two species,
he described the imago from the insect of the former, and the larva
(if he did not copy from Reaumur or Linn√©) from that of the latter.
Linn√© was correct in regarding Reaumur's three insects as distinct
species, though he appears to be mistaken in referring to him under
<i>N. flavus</i>, as the saw-fly of the currant and gooseberry is not wholly
yellow.</p>

1826 on the limes of the <i>All√©e Verte</i> at Brussels, that many of the
trees of that noble avenue, though of great age, were nearly deprived
of their leaves, and afforded little of the shade which the unusual
heat of the summer so urgently required. The moths which in autumn
proceeded from them, when in motion towards night, swarmed
like bees, and subsequently on the trunk of every tree might be seen
scores of females depositing their down-covered patch of eggs. In
the <i>Park</i> they were also very abundant; and it may be safely asserted
that if one half of the eggs deposited were to be hatched, in 1827
scarcely a leaf would remain in either of these favourite places of
public resort. Happily, however, this calamity seems likely to be prevented.
Of the vast number of patches of eggs which I saw on almost
every tree in the park about the end of September, I could
two months afterwards to my no small surprise, discover scarcely one,
though the singularity of the fact made me examine closely. For
their disappearance I have no doubt the inhabitants of Brussels are
indebted to the tit-mouse (<i>Parus</i>), the tree-creeper (<i>Certhia familiaris</i>),
and other small birds known to derive part of their food from
the eggs of insects, and which abound in the park, where they may
be often seen running up and down the trunks of the trees, at once
providing their own food and rendering a service to man, which all
his powers would be inadequate completely to effect.
</p>
<p>
Reaumur (ii. 106) in certain seasons found these patches of eggs so numerous, that in the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i> there was scarcely an oak,
the under side of the branches of which were not covered by them
for an extent of seven or eight feet. He informs us that the eggs
are not hatched till the following spring.</p>

into the woodwork of our docks and piers communicating with our
salt-water rivers, as at Hull, Liverpool, Bristol, Ipswich, &amp;c., where
it might be far more injurious than even on the coast, I have, since
December 15th 1815, when Mr. Lutwidge was so kind as to furnish
me with a piece of oak full of the insects in a living state, poured a
not very strong solution of common salt over the wood, every other
day, so as to keep the insects constantly wet. On examining it this
day (Feb. 5th 1816) I found them alive; and, what seems to prove
them in as good health as in their natural habitat, numbers have established
themselves in a piece of fir-wood which I nailed to the oak, and
have in this short interval, and in winter too, bored many cells in it.</p>

attack Lignum Vit√¶, but probably some essential oil disagreeable
to them with which it is impregnated. This is the more likely,
since they will eat it when it is old and has been long exposed to the
air. <i>Tannin</i> has been conjectured to be the protecting substance,
but erroneously, as leather of every kind is devoured by them. Williamson's
<i>East India Vade Mecum</i>, ii. 56. It is its hardness probably
that protects the iron-wood from the African Termites. Smeathman

me that the <i>Droguers</i> or <i>Draguers</i>, a kind of lighter employed in the
West Indies in collecting the sugar, sometimes so swarm with ants,
of the common kind, that they have no other way of getting rid of
these troublesome insects than by sinking the vessel in shallow water.</p>

evidently this beetle, or one nearly related to it, which is described
as rolling backwards large masses of dung, and attracted such general
attention as to give rise to the proverb <i>Cantharus pilulam</i>. It should
seem from the name, derived from a word signifying an ass, that the
Grecian beetle made its pills of asses' dung; and this is confirmed by
a passage in one of the plays of Aristophanes, the <i>Irene</i>, where a
beetle of this kind is introduced, on which one of the characters
rides to heaven to petition Jupiter for peace. The play begins with
one domestic desiring another to feed the Cantharus with some bread,
who afterwards orders his companion to give him another kind of
bread made of <i>asses'</i> dung.</p>

by the comparative anatomist, who has only to flay the body
of one of the smaller animals, anoint it with honey, and bury it in an

of every fibril of muscle, though with the ligaments and cartilages

<i>L. Excubitor</i>, called in America the nine-killer, from an idea that it
transfixes nine individuals daily, treats in this manner <i>Grasshoppers</i>
only; while <i>L. Collurio</i> would seem to restrict itself chiefly to <i>Geotrupes</i>,
two of which Mr. Sheppard once observed transfixed in a
hedge that he knew to be the residence of this bird. Kugellan even
thinks that it impales only <i>G. vernalis</i>, which he has often found
transfixed, but never <i>G. stercorarius</i>. (Schneid. <i>Mag.</i> 259.) I must
remark, however, that I last summer observed two <i>humble-bees</i> quite
alive, impaled on the thorns of a hedge near my house, which had
most probably been so placed by this species, <i>L. Excubitor</i> being rarely
found except in mountainous wilds. (Bewick's <i>Birds</i>, i. 61.) And
Prof. Sander states that on opening this bird (<i>L. Collurio</i>) he has
sometimes found in its stomach nothing but grasshoppers, and at

which have the taste of <i>Caviare</i>? Are they not insects' eggs resembling
the <i>Aguautle</i>, which I saw sold in the markets of Mexico, and
which are collected on the surface of the lakes of Texcuco?" For
this latter fact he refers to the <i>Gazeta de Litteratura de Mexico</i>.

formerly employed, is blood red: but Dr. Bancroft found (i. 404.)
that with the solution of tin used with cochineal it is capable of imparting
a scarlet quite as brilliant as that dye, and perhaps more permanent.
At the same time, however, as ten or twelve pounds contain
only as much colouring matter as one of cochineal, the latter at
its ordinary price is the cheapest.</p>

of ants to their young, for obtaining with little trouble a
collection of the pup√¶, which they sell as a dainty food for nightingales.
They scatter an ants' nest upon a dry plot of ground, surrounded
with a shallow trench of water, and place on one side of it
a few fir branches. Under these the ants, having no other alternative,
carefully arrange all their pup√¶, and in an hour or two the shepherd
finds a large heap clean and ready for market. Anderson's <i>Recreations

might have thrown some weight into the scale of those who contend
for the orthography adopted above, and that the meaning of <i>shard</i> in
this place is dung, if they had been aware that the beetle (<i>Geotrupes
stercorarius</i>) is actually <i>born</i> amongst dung, and no where else; and
that no beetle which makes a hum in flying can with propriety be said,
as Dr. Johnson has interpreted the epithet in his Dictionary, "to be
born amongst broken stones or pots." That Shakespeare alluded to
the Beetle, and not to the Cockchafer (<i>Melolontha vulgaris</i>), seems
clear from the fact of the former being to be heard in all places almost
every fine evening in the summer, while the latter is common
only in particular districts, and at one period of the year. S.</p>

with a proboscis, can scarcely be by suction, strictly so called,
or the abstraction of air, since the air-vessels of insects do not communicate
with their mouths: it is more probably performed in part
by capillary attraction; and, as Lamarck has suggested, (<i>Syst. des

of what precise species of aphidivorous fly it is the larva, nor can I
find a figure of it, though it approaches near to one given by De Geer
(vi. <i>t.</i> 7. <i>f.</i> 1-3). Its shape is oblong-oval, length about four lines,
and colour pale red speckled with black. Each of the seven or
eight segments which compose the body projects on each side into
three serrated flat aculei or teeth; three or four similar but smaller
aculei arm the head: and two, much larger than the rest, the anus,
one on each side of the usual bifid protuberance which bears the
respiratory plates. A bifid tubercular elevation is also placed in the
middle of the back of each segment.</p>

and the number of tubes issuing from it was more than a hundred.
He affirms that, besides the larger spinners, in the space between
them there are four smaller ones, each furnished with organs for
spinning threads, but smaller and fewer in number. Latreille speaks
only of a thousand spinners from each teat, and of six thousand
threads from the whole&mdash;but he does not enter further into the subject.

in Redi (<i>De Insectis</i>, p. 119.) from which it appears that Blancanus,
in his <i>Commentaries upon Aristotle</i>, has related a series of observations
which led him to precisely the same result. Lehmann,
too, in a paper in the <i>Transactions of the Society of Naturalists at
Berlin</i> (translated in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, xi. 323.) has given
an explanation somewhat similar of the operations of this very spider,
but I am inclined to think erroneous in some particulars. He describes it as emitting <i>numerous</i> floating threads at the <i>commencement</i>
of its descent. That he is mistaken in supposing these threads to be
more than one, is proved by the fact which I have observed&mdash;that
even that one sometimes breaks by the weight of the spider. How
then could an insect almost as big as a gooseberry be supported by a
line of the tenuity here attributed to it?</p>

planes which compose the cell are equal, <i>i. e.</i> 120¬∞: and he supposes
that this equality of inclination facilitates much the construction of
the cell, which may be a motive for preferring it, as well as economy.
He shows that the bees do not economize the wax necessary for
a flat bottom in the construction of every cell, near so much as
MM. K&#339;nig and Reaumur thought.
</p>
<p>
MacLaurin says, that the difference of a cell with a pyramidal
from one with a flat bottom, in which is comprised the economy of
the bees, is equal to the fourth part of six triangles, which it would be necessary to add to the trapeziums, the faces of the cell, in order
to make them right angles.
</p>
<p>
M. L'Huillier, professor of Geneva, values the economy of the bees
at 1/51 of the whole expense; and he shows that it might have been
one-fifth if the bees had no other circumstances to attend to; but
he concludes, that if it is not very sensible in every cell, it may be
considerable in the whole of a comb, on account of the mutual setting
of the two opposite orders of cells. Huber, <i>Nouvelles Observations</i>,

feet, is not more than 120 times the height of the workmen employed.
